en-unannotated-00001	Unsure.
en-unannotated-00002	The Survey Co occupies a narrow space in Burnett Lane as a mark to Brisbane's growing obsessions in redeveloping laneways a la Melbourne.
en-unannotated-00003	We all ordered classic burgers with bacon.
en-unannotated-00004	The atmosphere is superb.
en-unannotated-00005	I had the swordfish and it wss exceptional.
en-unannotated-00006	But they made room for us two after our tour.
en-unannotated-00007	We had the ceviche sampler.
en-unannotated-00008	Lovely coffee great service from friendly owners.
en-unannotated-00009	Always Be True to the Cuisine - Chef Dom D'Maestro
en-unannotated-00010	The prices were also not bad for the quality of the meal and the service ($25-30).
en-unannotated-00011	We had the most wonderful range of canapes and one guest who has coeliac issues was very well looked after.
en-unannotated-00012	Recommened this to everyone :)
en-unannotated-00013	Stayed at this hotel for one night with my husband and three year old daughter.
en-unannotated-00014	We stayed in nearby hotel and thought the menu looked unique and mostly affordable.
en-unannotated-00015	I took a few bites and left it.
en-unannotated-00016	For reference, it's listed as the Oeuf Cocotte aun epinards et creme de muscade.
en-unannotated-00017	The vegetarian cuisine was delicious (even my meat eating husband was happy!
en-unannotated-00018	For a mains course we decided on the Miso Barramundi with Japanese Mushrooms and Seaweed Salad as accompanying dishes.
en-unannotated-00019	My friend and I loved it.
en-unannotated-00020	we will look elsewhere to spend our calories.
en-unannotated-00021	Well make a reservation and try to avoid the busy hours.
en-unannotated-00022	We decided to go to The Box for drinks after reading really good reviews on TripAdvisor and in guidebooks we had purchased.
en-unannotated-00023	My first course--a chili, red pepper, prawn risotto--was out of this world.
en-unannotated-00024	On arrival was rudely ignored (it was not busy in the shop). The cakes I ordered where very small for the price.
en-unannotated-00025	We had a business meeting.
en-unannotated-00026	The Gaelic boxty was super yummy!
en-unannotated-00027	The food was not good, the refrigerator is hidden in a closet on a high shelf so for 2 days we couldn't find it, no coffee maker, microwave, no iron they will iron your clothes through a service for a fee.
en-unannotated-00028	Good free wifi access everywhere.
en-unannotated-00029	I'll be back!
en-unannotated-00030	I've been to Jellyfish several times.
en-unannotated-00031	Wifi signal was very weak in the room so that we had to come out to lobby to use Internet.
en-unannotated-00032	Yes, the chocolate fondant was worth it.
en-unannotated-00033	All of were very yummy!
en-unannotated-00034	The bathroom was completely remodeled and the shower was excellent.
en-unannotated-00035	Hailo was vastly superior.
en-unannotated-00036	This is how we entered the restaurant.
en-unannotated-00037	Call in advance or walk in the day and make a reservation.
en-unannotated-00038	Stayed 3 nights for a business trip with colleagues.
en-unannotated-00039	Good app
en-unannotated-00040	The BYOB (Build Your Own Burger) menu is perfect for the fussy eater like myself.
en-unannotated-00041	We enjoyed it so much we went twice!
en-unannotated-00042	magnificent...
en-unannotated-00043	Some room are still under internal renovation and not in good condition still sell to customer.
en-unannotated-00044	Also I could "preview" the available cabs around which i noticed I can't with this app.
en-unannotated-00045	Sort it out, it's wasting my phone storage, cos it doesn't work.
en-unannotated-00046	Yes, that was the end of the dinner while we watched plates and plates go by.
en-unannotated-00047	Our server was excellent in translating the menu for us and making her best recommendations.
en-unannotated-00048	FROM BREAKFAST TO BED.
en-unannotated-00049	As someone in this review-section pointed out, we sought a place to give our tourist-stomach a go.
en-unannotated-00050	Great staff!!
en-unannotated-00051	An all star meal without the pomp and circumstance.
en-unannotated-00052	My friend ordered an Irish Boxty and a drink which she said were both very good.
en-unannotated-00053	The buffet breakfast was fine, but a more extensively selection would be a nice improvement.
en-unannotated-00054	My husband and I got to Den Noc at about 11.30am which was the right timing as there were free seats.
en-unannotated-00055	The "cheesecake" looked & tasted like some sort of tuna dish I'd feed to my cat.
en-unannotated-00056	Very cool rooms and great location.
en-unannotated-00057	Incredibly "smart" photo app.
en-unannotated-00058	They recommended the salmon and steak boxty, but my dad was surprisingly a little underwhelmed by the Guinness stew.
en-unannotated-00059	Try the tamales, it looks different, but it is delicious!!!!
en-unannotated-00060	Suggested by our nearby hotel we should eat here for "fine dining". The restaurant is beautifully sited with views of nearby islands & the gulf of Ajaccio so one can watch the sunset..
en-unannotated-00061	I actually stayed here during a business trip in October 2015.
en-unannotated-00062	Well, this is so I really recommend the place.
en-unannotated-00063	We ate breakfast at the place next door and then we noticed these amazing burgers at naso.
en-unannotated-00064	The service was nice, the place itself was lovely...
en-unannotated-00065	Friendly.
en-unannotated-00066	Despite that, facilities impress and good restaurant service
en-unannotated-00067	We highly recommend this...
en-unannotated-00068	They take pride in serving their ancient beer and food in a way that warms my heart to have shared this experience with others.
en-unannotated-00069	I have just finished the second of my three week stay, on business, here at the Hilton and it is a wonderful hotel.
en-unannotated-00070	The food and service were both phenomenal!
en-unannotated-00071	You don't have to go the extra mile to keep the costumer, you have everything else working well for you.
en-unannotated-00072	I am a stickler for detail and service.
en-unannotated-00073	It was creamy and the crust was perfect.
en-unannotated-00074	Best coffee in Moscow according to my coffee snob husband from California :) Amazing homemade Italian pastries.
en-unannotated-00075	Super quaint restaurant decorated to make you feel as if you're eating at home.
en-unannotated-00076	Service was genuine and prompt.
en-unannotated-00077	and the food more than excellent..
en-unannotated-00078	The hotel is very nice, modern, clean.
en-unannotated-00079	I personally ordered the fish and chips and could not have been happier.
en-unannotated-00080	10k in length just to die and start over.
en-unannotated-00081	Lacked flavor and the outside was tough due to searing before
en-unannotated-00082	This may be my own ignorance, but the dish, as tasty and flavoursome as it was, came with a bit of a surprise and slight confusion as the menu didn't exactly describe what being was seen and tasting.
en-unannotated-00083	Unusual but effective and imaginative conversion of a 1600s building.
en-unannotated-00084	The staff were eager to make our stay perfect.
en-unannotated-00085	Leave room for their delicious baked goods...
en-unannotated-00086	As a starter, i had the tomato and mozzarella salad, which was delicious.
en-unannotated-00087	I started with the roasted red pepper tomato basil soup.
en-unannotated-00088	And very friendly!
en-unannotated-00089	Only downside is the lack of seating, it's always packed and you can barely fit, that's if you're lucky enough to get a seat!
en-unannotated-00090	Simple, not much of challenge.
en-unannotated-00091	Of course; they are 800 years old, so they are doing a lot of things right!
en-unannotated-00092	You get what you pay for.
en-unannotated-00093	Having said this, the location and the spaciousness of the apartment made up for it's worn look
en-unannotated-00094	One with children and one which is grilled cheese
en-unannotated-00095	If I had the money, I could very well get used to eating here.
en-unannotated-00096	Nice location, fantastic breakfast and very comfortable large room.
en-unannotated-00097	Went here expecting something great and maybe that was my downfall.
en-unannotated-00098	Very good for revving up your appetite.
en-unannotated-00099	This cosy little Ballsbridge gem is about as good as it gets.
en-unannotated-00100	My friend had the eggplant and olive risotto and enjoyed it as well.
en-unannotated-00101	Price is seriously cheap.
en-unannotated-00102	Almost national Russian food - vareniks: the dough with different filling!
en-unannotated-00103	The atmosphere is pretty classy; white cloth and waiter service with a candle, dimly lit but still good to come for lunch.
en-unannotated-00104	Greeted by a motorised sliding metal gate which opens to reveal the long, narrow dining hall, there is a certain secret hidden hideout vibe to the restaurant.
en-unannotated-00105	Mains were of high quality too, and we polished up every bit of the food, including (especially!
en-unannotated-00106	below the specific item you're looking at.
en-unannotated-00107	Very touristy place because it is recommended by a nearby hotel.
en-unannotated-00108	This was our first meal of our first visit to Prague.
en-unannotated-00109	My only gripe was that the dish felt like potato over kill because pretty much all the sides were potatoes and I was hoping for more variety.
en-unannotated-00110	Central and within walking distance of the old town where you can enjoy one of the many great tapas restaurants.
en-unannotated-00111	Beds are comfortable with clean, crisp sheets.
en-unannotated-00112	The decor was really cute as well.
en-unannotated-00113	and the food is amazing (!) but it is also is very very heavy (probably because of its authenticity). An amazing experience.
en-unannotated-00114	Alle fresh and a couple of Seats outside.
en-unannotated-00115	Factor in the river view, deduct the waitress who needed a personality transplant, add the fact they served at 3pm and the answer is yes, due to great food!
en-unannotated-00116	Nice and quite atmosphere.
en-unannotated-00117	(It wasn't until two days later when we escaped Prague for the countryside that we realized how bad the Goulash at Lokal actually was.)
en-unannotated-00118	We stayed in this hotel for four nights after a very long trip from Sydney.
en-unannotated-00119	Then I had the caprese salad, which had really flavorful tomatoes and fresh mozzarella!
en-unannotated-00120	A lot of people would rely on this now, I personally met a lot of good people on here and made very meaningful memories with them.
en-unannotated-00121	Friendly service, amazing decor and a live pianist to boot.
en-unannotated-00122	The Dry-Aged Hamburger (159 czk / $8.19) took about 15 minutes to be ready, but it was worth the wait.
en-unannotated-00123	No thanks.
en-unannotated-00124	I ordered a chicken and bacon boxty, and my boyfriend went with the traditional Irish boxty which had beef and mushrooms.
en-unannotated-00125	This place is known for its duck so that's exactly what we got.
en-unannotated-00126	One of the best meals we had while we were in France, beautiful little spot.
en-unannotated-00127	You design it for me and make it as per the menu.
en-unannotated-00128	There are several restaurants and eateries right next door and around the corners.
en-unannotated-00129	For my antipasti, I had a salad with mussels and oranges, and it was such a light refreshing start to the meal.
en-unannotated-00130	We had chicken roast with vegetables and beef with green beans.
en-unannotated-00131	The trio was shared between two men and there was enough left to share each preparation of the lamb and out vegetables with others.
en-unannotated-00132	He takes pride in the presentation of the food and the combination of tastes just explode on your taste buds.
en-unannotated-00133	And y'all know what a complete foodie I am.
en-unannotated-00134	Owner is helpful, kind, friendly, shop is beautifully designed and decorated.
en-unannotated-00135	That beefy smell is so sinfully seductive it makes you want to bathe in it.
en-unannotated-00136	Good place for a special dinner.
en-unannotated-00137	See the photos for names/ look of the dishes.
en-unannotated-00138	It was not so simple, the restaurant was fully booked.
en-unannotated-00139	Breakfast was exactly the same everyday, no variety and not enough hot food.
en-unannotated-00140	A real gem.
en-unannotated-00141	I will come back again as it is in the business district for meetings.
en-unannotated-00142	We first arrived in Prague late Sunday afternoon in September.
en-unannotated-00143	Eventually, we had to ask another waiter (a younger man) regarding the timing of our food- at this point, my friends and I had already waited for over an hour.
en-unannotated-00144	We were staying at the Vincci Centrum but disappointed by the general service we decided to venture out on the street for breakfast.
en-unannotated-00145	If you craving Mexican food and want to try gourmet food you have to go this restaurant.
en-unannotated-00146	Easy to use.
en-unannotated-00147	We had picklade spicy brie and cabbagepancakes.
en-unannotated-00148	It was super rare and very bland.
en-unannotated-00149	It tasted like any other lager which is crisp, clean and refreshing with no bite and no character.
en-unannotated-00150	The hotel is wonderfully old and elegant.
en-unannotated-00151	Beautiful spot, great beer, delicious food (had the seafood linguine). Classy little place to go, didn't disappoint.
en-unannotated-00152	Highly recommend this location and the Lokal Inn near the Charles Bridge on the castle side.
en-unannotated-00153	Highly recommend this place.
en-unannotated-00154	So remember!
en-unannotated-00155	This place is very easy to reach.
en-unannotated-00156	I wanted to keep my appetite for the food so I only took a bite or two.
en-unannotated-00157	The staff speaks English too.
en-unannotated-00158	First off, it was small, off the beaten path, they spoke Italian, and lastly the secret to finding really good gelato was to find that the gelato...
en-unannotated-00159	My friend and I both opted for onion soup which was truly lovely - not salty, and full of wonderfully caramelized onions.
en-unannotated-00160	Astor is located down a quiet street that forks off of the very busy Calle Cava Baja.
en-unannotated-00161	(Featured at the begining of Spectre Bond Film) Very good staff who are friendly and efficient.
en-unannotated-00162	And found out that everything is correct and even better!!
en-unannotated-00163	Sometimes the staff were a bit slow, for example it took over an hour for a drinks menu to be brought to our room so we ended up going down to get it.
en-unannotated-00164	nice
en-unannotated-00165	I loved how Burnett lane is this somewhat hidden side street off the main Queen st mall area with a handful of cool bars and restaurants.
en-unannotated-00166	I would recommend this place to anyone!
en-unannotated-00167	If burgers aren't your thing and you have had the misfortune of somehow ending up here, you can get a Sirloin Steak or some fish and chips or salad.
en-unannotated-00168	I do recommend purchasing the full game.
en-unannotated-00169	Rooms view to the ugly walls beside the hotel or not soundproofed windows in the front rooms.
en-unannotated-00170	We ordered the expensive homard (lobster) dish for lunch, and it was clearly not fresh.
en-unannotated-00171	I enjoyed a delicious lunch at this charming restaurant which is located not far from the Pinacoteca di Brera.
en-unannotated-00172	I tried to order the cannolo but they were out.
en-unannotated-00173	Updates frequently break the app.
en-unannotated-00174	Without hesitation, they moved us to another room at the rear of the hotel, and even have new windows on order for the front rooms we were in.
en-unannotated-00175	Location.
en-unannotated-00176	We try and see who can have the highest score.
en-unannotated-00177	I always walk down through the parking lot on Elizabeth street side, but I'm pretty sure you're not really supposed to...
en-unannotated-00178	Waiters are happy to help with menu.
en-unannotated-00179	Friendly staff.
en-unannotated-00180	Shared 3 small plates: orzo, risotto and feta/sweet potato.
en-unannotated-00181	However, we didn't mind waiting too much, and our waitress was again, very sweet.
en-unannotated-00182	We found it on an American blog on our search for Prague's best duck leg, and the place was full of Americans the night we were there.
en-unannotated-00183	We came right at open (11 am) for lunch as we had just arrived and our hotel room wasn't quite ready yet.
en-unannotated-00184	Deserts were delicious as well and the chocolate cake was the standout!
en-unannotated-00185	Ditto to past comments.
en-unannotated-00186	We booked 2 nights at the NH Collection in San Sebastián after 3 wonderful nights at their Madrid hotel.
en-unannotated-00187	But I think its a little bit expensive though.
en-unannotated-00188	Exceptionally courteous, professional and helpful staff who genuinely made us feel very welcome and at home.
en-unannotated-00189	From the amazing recommendations to the free lemoncello and cookies - I'd highly recommend going back here!
en-unannotated-00190	I left about 1/3 of it on the plate because I couldn't eat any more of the cream.
en-unannotated-00191	Ordered the potato wedges as a side (small size, but lots of them!)
en-unannotated-00192	It is a twin bed room with beds pushed together.
en-unannotated-00193	we got [name].
en-unannotated-00194	The decoration and the music is very good!
en-unannotated-00195	So clean and bright.
en-unannotated-00196	Staff were friendly and helpful.
en-unannotated-00197	The risotto of prawn was excellent - spicer than we expected for the area.
en-unannotated-00198	If you want a good meat - come here.
en-unannotated-00199	It's bigger than expected, lots of long tables and fairly crowded.
en-unannotated-00200	The main star though was the gnocchi alla Oscar.
en-unannotated-00201	Both the shrimp and squid dishes were good, very simple and packed with flavor.
en-unannotated-00202	Terrible service
en-unannotated-00203	We got the house cocktail with forest fruit and cucumber flavour infused rums and they were fantastic.
en-unannotated-00204	The plug in the basin did not fit properly and leaked.
en-unannotated-00205	Hotel is in premium location really fantastic to tour the city from the hotel by foot
en-unannotated-00206	it is great....
en-unannotated-00207	Technogym apparels in the gym that open at 7am (6am would have been even better).
en-unannotated-00208	Overall a good experience.
en-unannotated-00209	The ambiance is super cozy too!
en-unannotated-00210	Listed as one of the top restaurants in Paris, the place can get crowded, on top of being tiny.
en-unannotated-00211	It came with sweet potato, onion rings, string beans in tomato sauce on the side.
en-unannotated-00212	Cozy.
en-unannotated-00213	It's a place where hundreds of unrecognised and new musicians can send their music for people to stream from all over.
en-unannotated-00214	Nicely situated close to both Atocha station and the museums, this hotel has everything a tourist could need: clean, comfortable rooms with A/C, a great breakfast.
en-unannotated-00215	It's cool that you can create your own and they were fast delivering.
en-unannotated-00216	Waiter/waitresses finish it up by cleaning the edges of every plate going, so it's pretty cool to watch.
en-unannotated-00217	Sisters Isabel and Pilar are a perfect chef / hostess team and their charm makes a visit to their restaurant a must.
en-unannotated-00218	I would recommend it.
en-unannotated-00219	As you walk into the restaurant you immediately feel like you've stepped into a business that knows what it's doing.
en-unannotated-00220	Really enjoyed it!
en-unannotated-00221	the whole place was so beautiful and clean, great view and everything here is so perfect
en-unannotated-00222	The potatoes came with a good amount of smoked salmon and were mixed with the cream sauce.
en-unannotated-00223	On duty staff seemed overwhelmed.
en-unannotated-00224	Vegies and salad?
en-unannotated-00225	The place is decked out really well.
en-unannotated-00226	There was live music and people were singing - so much fun!
en-unannotated-00227	If you can make a reservation, I strongly recommend it.
en-unannotated-00228	It always gets jammers though on weekends, and I definitely prefered the vibe when I came in on a tuesday evening.
en-unannotated-00229	Very well located- Walking distance from all the major touristic attractions in Rome, well connected with public transportation to all the city.
en-unannotated-00230	I would highly recommend this place for any occasion.
en-unannotated-00231	This provided a surprising amount of food and was perfect for lunch.
en-unannotated-00232	The ambiance is still wonderful, the service impeccable and the food perfectly prepared and executed.
en-unannotated-00233	Very kind door man gave my family full explanation on how to get the airport, what terminal we do need, how much we should pay!
en-unannotated-00234	It's lively and noisy and just a great place to hang out.
en-unannotated-00235	Breakfast is excellent with a lovely range of hot and cold food.
en-unannotated-00236	We made sure we made it to Dublin to stay here.
en-unannotated-00237	Holiday Inn or Crowne Plaza hotels are far better values in you want IHG
en-unannotated-00238	If you just want to relax and read a book you should visit monday through thursday because it gets quite packed and noisy when the weekend comes.
en-unannotated-00239	So much fun aura.
en-unannotated-00240	I ordered the prawns.
en-unannotated-00241	I was a bit hesitant to book this hotel being it's a Best Western.
en-unannotated-00242	Don't be surprised if you're seated to and share a table with someone else.
en-unannotated-00243	I know they get busy but they need to keep this in mind and potentially employ more chefs.
en-unannotated-00244	Aesthetics aside, Blackbird delivers in all aspects of quality of food, exceptional service & value for money.
en-unannotated-00245	Yum!
en-unannotated-00246	It's definitely not the easiest place to find so make sure you have good directions before you go.
en-unannotated-00247	We had a late lunch there (rare in France as restaurants close at 2pm) - a burger and a salad - both were great!
en-unannotated-00248	Had spotify for quite a few years, shortly after they started up to be exact.
en-unannotated-00249	Some combinations can be a little schloppy (because lets face it, they don't skimp on ingredients), but when its 10pm and that grilled beef smell hits my nostrils, looking pretty while I eat is the least of my worries.
en-unannotated-00250	when our meal was finished they brought us a bottle of house made Limoncello, again complimenti.
en-unannotated-00251	Food quality is pretty good....
en-unannotated-00252	Best available in this town!
en-unannotated-00253	It's so light and delicious!
en-unannotated-00254	The food is great.
en-unannotated-00255	Spotlessly clean, well decorated and comfortable room.
en-unannotated-00256	Particularly the Gina Rinehart lemon curd cocktail, which was essentially a lemon tart squeezed into an oh so delicious cocktail.
en-unannotated-00257	Appetizer plus entree plus a beer (don't remember which one) cost around $13-14. Love these Czech prices.
en-unannotated-00258	I went for the Pork Knee roasted on beer with horseradish and mustard.
en-unannotated-00259	I was not sure what to expect when I booked this event.
en-unannotated-00260	We sat on bar stools at the counter and had coffee, fresh orange juice and toast with tomato, avocado, ham.
en-unannotated-00261	Sadly, I was too full for any sort of dessert.
en-unannotated-00262	Great stay.
en-unannotated-00263	Dinner took approximately three hours and we were served 8 different plates.
en-unannotated-00264	It was a pretty spacious space, but only eating at the bar standing.
en-unannotated-00265	The bread is rye unless you, like my wife, hate rye and specifically ask them to bake you a roll (thanks kitchen staff ^.^).
en-unannotated-00266	The place is at the downtown of Mexico City, is great for having breakfast, lunch and dinner.
en-unannotated-00267	Cheap food and beer.
en-unannotated-00268	Let's just leave it at that- give it a try, you won't regret it.
en-unannotated-00269	Hope to go back soon!
en-unannotated-00270	On a recommendation, I gave the Korean beef burger a run, and it blew me away.
en-unannotated-00271	We both had brioche buns (you can choose ciabatta of you prefer), and they were perfectly toasted to accompany the taste.
en-unannotated-00272	Was very crowdy yesterday for lunch ☺.
en-unannotated-00273	I had my first FRENCH Onion Soup and it was superb, the Beef medallions were great the presentation fitting for a top rated restaurant.
en-unannotated-00274	Definitely my recommendation if you want to try Czech food.
en-unannotated-00275	Nice ambience and quick serving.
en-unannotated-00276	Personally, I ordered the steak and it was cooked to perfection.
en-unannotated-00277	Definitely better than going to a regular restaurant because of the social contact with chef and staff and the other guests.
en-unannotated-00278	Great location and location Good food.
en-unannotated-00279	My new restaurant crush for this rentrée 2015!
en-unannotated-00280	The food was just about average, The price is for the interiors and they are as if from the Czar's Palace.
en-unannotated-00281	I was barely halfway done with my beer when she came back to us and told us there was a table available.
en-unannotated-00282	Soon after our order was taken we were given a basket of breads and truffle mushroom butter.
en-unannotated-00283	Located directly at the beach of a nice bay they serve delicious fresh seafood and good Corsican wines.
en-unannotated-00284	Not only was the food amazing, but so was the service and the ambience.
en-unannotated-00285	Finally we found an amazing local restaurant.
en-unannotated-00286	If you are looking for quality fresh food you will not be disappointed.
en-unannotated-00287	Inside a big mall, the restaurant is large, popular, and decorated in Soviet style.
en-unannotated-00288	It is located NOT in the Old Town but close enough to the main drag of town.
en-unannotated-00289	He gave us chocolate and coffee to take back on our flight home!
en-unannotated-00290	The food was amazing - between us we has the pork, the fish, and the lamb ribs - each dish better then the other.
en-unannotated-00291	They could not do enough for us and fell over themselves being friendly and accommodating.
en-unannotated-00292	I just want to play the freaking game already!
en-unannotated-00293	Come when you have the time to enjoy the evening and a tasting menu that will transport you cleverly on a trip around the world.
en-unannotated-00294	Carne muy rica, pero el servicio medio lento.
en-unannotated-00295	I had a tomato, mozzarella and pistachio pesto ...
en-unannotated-00296	Good location.
en-unannotated-00297	The service was flawless and a special note to the sommelier who provided great wine pairings throughout the meal.
en-unannotated-00298	however the customer service is weak and they just do not pay enough attention to detail regarding amenities
en-unannotated-00299	Lovely friendly staff, hotel character is amazing, although a little tired, it was a beautiful grandiose hotel.
en-unannotated-00300	it is a very small intimate dining experience with just the chef and his assistant doing everything to make...
en-unannotated-00301	basically cooked perfectly!
en-unannotated-00302	excellent staff especially the front desk gentleman Friday afternoon 5-19-17 who had to deal with some rude people due to late check in issues.
en-unannotated-00303	Absolutely amazing pizza!
en-unannotated-00304	The prosciutto toastie kind of let me down a little and just tasted like a normal sandwich with pickled onions.
en-unannotated-00305	The location was smack in the middle of where we wanted to be.
en-unannotated-00306	The stew was really rich in flavor and worked really well with the mash potatoes.
en-unannotated-00307	Perfect location.
en-unannotated-00308	its the only way to eat a steak here.
en-unannotated-00309	The beef goulash is pretty standard and decent food.
en-unannotated-00310	Oddly, some of the mains come in a medium or large size, I ordered large being quite hungry and not really knowing the difference or why the choice existed.
en-unannotated-00311	:-) Definitely better than other fidget spinner apps.
en-unannotated-00312	Very helpful staff especially the consierge.
en-unannotated-00313	Service was friendly and efficient.
en-unannotated-00314	I ordered the sweet pancakes with strawberry, mint and mascarpone which was 135 czk.
en-unannotated-00315	The food is out of this world.
en-unannotated-00316	They make you feel so welcome and its not...
en-unannotated-00317	Good classic but good.
en-unannotated-00318	Shower was difficult to manoveur shower heads
en-unannotated-00319	Service is quick, ambiance is elegant, and hot chocolate is the best.
en-unannotated-00320	Delicious and fresh.
en-unannotated-00321	Definitely worth a stop.
en-unannotated-00322	otherwise all is okei..
en-unannotated-00323	The bathrooms in the rooms were nicely remodeled and modern, but it is an older property that needs refurbishment.
en-unannotated-00324	Your friendly Irish girl who allowed us generous samples of the light beers (Guinness had us quite full from the factory tour). Unique theme and clean.
en-unannotated-00325	Food of high quality, service a bit slow hence no 5 stars from me.
en-unannotated-00326	this time i ordered some different dished - sole and lamb.
en-unannotated-00327	We are each year in Milan during fashion week and Mifur.
en-unannotated-00328	it will not replay  or work then you will get a message saying something went wrong..
en-unannotated-00329	We sat down right away and got to ordering:
en-unannotated-00330	After the new update, my league shows I've won over 100k but on my friends list it shows 400 coins?
en-unannotated-00331	great location..
en-unannotated-00332	From a food point of view, this was the highlight of our trip to Paris and next time we come back to this city, this is a MUST on our To-Do-List!
en-unannotated-00333	Really, that was the wrong reason and the quality was top rate.
en-unannotated-00334	There may be a line outside but isnt that true of all great local places.
en-unannotated-00335	The food was so good that we immediately ordered for dinner!!
en-unannotated-00336	When our meals came, we quickly dug in.
en-unannotated-00337	Excellent location, right in the centre of Rome.
en-unannotated-00338	Words can not describe the experience we had at this place, food is AMAZING service and staff are super nice.
en-unannotated-00339	hello mysterious alley way!
en-unannotated-00340	If you're not used to street noises at night the appartment does not have double glazed Windows so we found it quite noisy when trying to sleep.
en-unannotated-00341	The game is awesome.
en-unannotated-00342	Interestingly, the potato side was cooked in a clay pot which was broken up and displayed on the plate.
en-unannotated-00343	Super friendly staff and owner.
en-unannotated-00344	All the personal was very attentive and polite.
en-unannotated-00345	Never received wake up call.
en-unannotated-00346	Found this little shop - clean, bare bones, fast food setting.
en-unannotated-00347	The only message they responded to was my request to pay before we arrived.
en-unannotated-00348	a must!
en-unannotated-00349	A fitting end to a great meal and dining experience.
en-unannotated-00350	You don't appreciate the difference a window makes until you find yourself in a hotel room without one !
en-unannotated-00351	The front desk personnel were extremely helpful in assisting us in navigating the city via bus and subway.
en-unannotated-00352	Arriving at Las Alcobas you know that it's going to be nice.
en-unannotated-00353	Highly recommended.
en-unannotated-00354	And also a shout out to Lani P for shining the Bat Signal on this spot for me.
en-unannotated-00355	It is very casual and simple but the staff treat you very well.
en-unannotated-00356	We received a delicious egg frittata type dish, which I thought would be complimentary, like bread in restaurants.
en-unannotated-00357	Great app works well no issues so far!
en-unannotated-00358	Soon after opening, I went to check it out with a few friends when we were looking for a dinner spot but being a Friday evening we were told apologetically that it was completely booked out....
en-unannotated-00359	Large windows made a special plus!
en-unannotated-00360	From the food to the service and decor Absolutely magnifico.
en-unannotated-00361	We ordered their beer board which was a collection of smoked meats and pickles foods.
en-unannotated-00362	Great food and service.
en-unannotated-00363	And everything was perfect except internal temperature.
en-unannotated-00364	Location is close to one of the business areas as well as to the best restaurants.
en-unannotated-00365	Is like a bohemian place with vintage furniture and good music.
en-unannotated-00366	Had a work dinner here and we were in the private dining room around the back.
en-unannotated-00367	We recomend it.
en-unannotated-00368	And let me just say, this place is where to eat.
en-unannotated-00369	For my second meal, I ordered the beer goulash in a bread bowl.
en-unannotated-00370	Beef tartare comes w/ toasted bread slices and a garlic clove to rub onto the bread with.
en-unannotated-00371	Very good location and reasonable priced.
en-unannotated-00372	The breakfast was bad and the food dose not fit for a five star Hotel.
en-unannotated-00373	Turning Guest mode off still allows anyone on the network with an Android device to control the Chromecast (everyone that has access to my wifi shouldn't automatically have access to control my device). It would be nice to eventually be able to connect USB storage devices directly up to the Chromecast.
en-unannotated-00374	Very good steaks of great quality.
en-unannotated-00375	Enjoyed meeting people from different countries.
en-unannotated-00376	My dining companion had the chicken and leek boxty.
en-unannotated-00377	But the staff were very helpful and friendly.
en-unannotated-00378	We had the cheese and meat plate and ceased salad.
en-unannotated-00379	* Eat the complimentary bread!
en-unannotated-00380	In financial district within a nice area with foid options, but 30 mn from center town
en-unannotated-00381	The waiter was so awesome and helpful.
en-unannotated-00382	The cocktails were well balanced (strong but didn't taste strong?!) and fun (the drinks we ordered had honeycomb and lemon curd!)
en-unannotated-00383	Once when we were famished and hoping for a good meal, and another time when we missed the spoonfuls of goodness that we had just devoured.
en-unannotated-00384	Let me preface this by stating that I am a huge fan of the Room Mate Hotel chain.
en-unannotated-00385	A friend of mine booked the Champagne room, one of the private rooms.
en-unannotated-00386	La Provence de Andrei did not disappoint!!!
en-unannotated-00387	It was a pleasure to share some time with them and enjoy their exquisite culinary skills.
en-unannotated-00388	drinks menu was great just the food although nice as you'll read from all the other posts here, not really my cup of tea so do speak...
en-unannotated-00389	The food!
en-unannotated-00390	Ordered a Beef Tartare and two mixed meat sausages.
en-unannotated-00391	Excellent restaurant easy accessible from the harbour.
en-unannotated-00392	Best restaurant especially if you have a few hours transferring trains as this place is a 3 min walk from Milano Central Station.
en-unannotated-00393	If u guys add more featurs in it,  like sound and also vibration and screen rotation feature it would be nyc
en-unannotated-00394	I was very happy with my visit.
en-unannotated-00395	Amazing food, casual atmosphere, great location.
en-unannotated-00396	This needs fixing then I'd give a 5 star rating.
en-unannotated-00397	I can't wait to take my husband back there later for more!!
en-unannotated-00398	There was only one waitress to manage all the tables plus...
en-unannotated-00399	This one will be placed on our group's top choices for traveling abroad!
en-unannotated-00400	It's...
en-unannotated-00401	Was good when it first came about.
en-unannotated-00402	Very close to many businesses and restaurant.
en-unannotated-00403	Room was very clean and adequate for a business trip.
en-unannotated-00404	Although it was a bit of an inconvenience to get to......
en-unannotated-00405	This was an unsurpassed dining experience that repeatedly touched upon perfection.
en-unannotated-00406	Great location, the staff was ok only one receptionist was friendly the others was not so , fairly clean,  bed was comfort .
en-unannotated-00407	Some of the best staff I have dealt with.
en-unannotated-00408	Very affordable as well.
en-unannotated-00409	Great seafood and pastas!
en-unannotated-00410	There aren't many tables, so I can see where a reservation is strongly recommended.
en-unannotated-00411	Beautiful century-old hotel, charmingly old-fashioned.
en-unannotated-00412	For an appetizer, I shared the egg foie gras coquette, it was absolutely divine.
en-unannotated-00413	The soup was combined with melted cheese and bread.
en-unannotated-00414	wonderful service and food.
en-unannotated-00415	They have mostly pancakes (and they're very good). The place is small so you're probably best to get there right after opening to snag a table.
en-unannotated-00416	Came here after exploring Guinness storehouse and trinity college!
en-unannotated-00417	The accommodation,  decoration style, layout is very good and compliments the period building.
en-unannotated-00418	The location is great - very close to many attractions and easy access to 2 separate metro stations - Opera and Santo Domingo.
en-unannotated-00419	But when they played if there time is out they played easily...
en-unannotated-00420	Amazing pasta!
en-unannotated-00421	The bathroom is maybe 2 stars.
en-unannotated-00422	Service was good and they were very accommodating with letting us move to a table near an outlet.
en-unannotated-00423	nothing really comes close to this (except for maybe all the other gelato places I came to love).
en-unannotated-00424	It's always busy but both times they have got my orders out in under 5 minutes.
en-unannotated-00425	I liked the location and the facilities.
en-unannotated-00426	Standouts include the goats cheese and chicken gnocchi, brandy tortellini and chilli vodka and artichoke risotto.
en-unannotated-00427	The bartender was super friendly and was happy to serve us even though we arrived late.
en-unannotated-00428	They also take credit card and you can tip on the card which is nice.
en-unannotated-00429	We have gone twice to Sakona and we will return tomorrow.
en-unannotated-00430	Check early bird specials for even more value.
en-unannotated-00431	They serve their own craft brew which is quite good.
en-unannotated-00432	My girlfriend and I were visiting from the US and this place rivaled many of the chicken places we have back home in Texas.
en-unannotated-00433	This was exceptional.
en-unannotated-00434	Drive and park on underground public parking within city center or
en-unannotated-00435	It was from the fish dish that the table next to us ordered.
en-unannotated-00436	Great in all aspects.
en-unannotated-00437	I don’t have too many doubts about that.
en-unannotated-00438	Currently on vacay in Italy and works perfectly!
en-unannotated-00439	I was there as a part of a retirement dinner so my wallet didn't suffer, however I would consider returning with my own money (and that is saying something).
en-unannotated-00440	The first place we visited in Ireland and it did not disappoint.
en-unannotated-00441	Fun place!
en-unannotated-00442	Very clean.
en-unannotated-00443	I am only now writing about my experience at W Hotel as i stayed there back in April, and must say that i still think about the bed to this day.
en-unannotated-00444	Immediately I was approached and seated by the friendly, humorous and slightly overexcited staff.
en-unannotated-00445	The heater bars leak water on the floor.
en-unannotated-00446	This isn't fine dining but it's cheap and atmospheric .
en-unannotated-00447	Keep saying error at the start on the latest advert...
en-unannotated-00448	Very friendly and helpful staff.
en-unannotated-00449	I had a two night stay here and I wasn't sure what to expect because the previous reviews were a bit mixed.
en-unannotated-00450	It doesn't have many tables outside and only a few inside.
en-unannotated-00451	Their chocolate pastry was awesome.
en-unannotated-00452	The beer was great and the prices reasonable.
en-unannotated-00453	Location.
en-unannotated-00454	I use my mobile as hotspot and also to cast content.
en-unannotated-00455	The deserts are the best.
en-unannotated-00456	Value for money in what is a fantastic short break destination.
en-unannotated-00457	It's either all or nothing and the rooms we had, a premier Inn is better!
en-unannotated-00458	We fell into this bar just because it was convenient and near the main square.
en-unannotated-00459	We had some beers and ordered a couple of bacon burgers - literally a bacon patty.
en-unannotated-00460	Good location and the supermarket close by was great.
en-unannotated-00461	Great coffee, fantastic food & happy staff.
en-unannotated-00462	It's definitely a great choice to have while on the go!
en-unannotated-00463	5 Stars hotel should have firm comfortable mattresses.
en-unannotated-00464	I had some gorgeous pancakes, coffee and at more than affordable prices.
en-unannotated-00465	I always come back when here.
en-unannotated-00466	Last Saturday 10/06, after working from 9am to serve people on the restaurant I work located just about 900 meters from Pmacs (where I go a few times for a couple of years, even in others pubs from them) I go around 11:30pm to meet my girlfriend and friends that were waiting for me.
en-unannotated-00467	Even our sides were delicious.
en-unannotated-00468	Free parking at the back is a bonus.
en-unannotated-00469	This laneway restaurant and bar was THE place to be last Saturday night after fashion week was cancelled, with a host of fashion bloggers and designers turning up to drink some wine and look attractive (translation: it's hip.
en-unannotated-00470	An amazing chef restaurant in Propriano!!!
en-unannotated-00471	I'd highly suggest trying this.
en-unannotated-00472	The place can get a little cramped for larger parties but worth it.
en-unannotated-00473	The food and service is exceptional.
en-unannotated-00474	The service here was extraordinary!
en-unannotated-00475	Great job!
en-unannotated-00476	My heart was sold on the roasted duck over the bed of rissotto in Brno that I was craving it for the Prague location.
en-unannotated-00477	Whilst traditionally it can be a spicy Spanish dish, this one was a beautiful sweeter tomato base with a delicious aioli, & the potatoes were larger cuts.
en-unannotated-00478	I have NO IDEA what the cheese was, but it was like butter.
en-unannotated-00479	Read several reviews about this place and decided to go for lunch.
en-unannotated-00480	Had a room overlooking the busy street but because of double windows it was very quiet.
en-unannotated-00481	The room, however, is a bit dated.
en-unannotated-00482	There should be some sort of timer to maske it more difficult.
en-unannotated-00483	The room was unlike the photo shown and asked for more money when we asked to change rooms, the staff were very rude and unhelpfull, they became very defensive and angry when we told them about our room, very rude staff.
en-unannotated-00484	Spanish-style cuisine, modernized and with the chef's personal touch.
en-unannotated-00485	Downloads disappear!
en-unannotated-00486	Service was a little slow at lunch but good.
en-unannotated-00487	This is an interesting "themed" hotel -- the theme is cinema, with the rooms themed each with a different movie star.
en-unannotated-00488	It's a butcher shop located a few minutes away from the Old Town Square.
en-unannotated-00489	Well seem they very busy !
en-unannotated-00490	Most of my reviews are but a few sentences, so take this one as a sign to just as how special this place really is.
en-unannotated-00491	Efficient service and English menu available.
en-unannotated-00492	Foie Carpaccio: interesting dish!
en-unannotated-00493	Very impressive, highly recommend and will return.
en-unannotated-00494	And not expensive at all, really worth it :)
en-unannotated-00495	I've loved Mario since I was a boy with a GameCube and although I downloaded Run a few days ago, yesterday I really sunk my teeth into it and know it's good.
en-unannotated-00496	We are standing in this awesome bar watching the locals come and enjoy a drink and a great assortment of pintxos.
en-unannotated-00497	Good wine list.
en-unannotated-00498	Will not be reserving a room at this hotel in the future.
en-unannotated-00499	Not easy to get English translation.
en-unannotated-00500	place is really nice and special.
en-unannotated-00501	It's like crack, addictive to its death.
en-unannotated-00502	3. Beers!
en-unannotated-00503	Even tho this wasn't the best pasta dish I've ever had in Italy it still tasted pretty good and it was al dente.
en-unannotated-00504	The rooftop dining experience provided excellent views of the city.
en-unannotated-00505	I opted for a duck leg with potato dumplings and sauerkraut for less than $15 American, with a side of garlic bread for under two bucks.
en-unannotated-00506	Amazing!
en-unannotated-00507	I came here for lunch with European friends who live in NYC for more than twenty years.
en-unannotated-00508	My boyfriend isn't that into food (unlike me) yet he raved about this place and even recommended it to a friend planning a Prague visit.
en-unannotated-00509	The Restaurant is large, good selection of wine and of course the selection of meat.
en-unannotated-00510	Parking outside the restaurant.
en-unannotated-00511	I should be number one on my friends list right now, but I'm number four.
en-unannotated-00512	Easy to point and take food that looks appetising.
en-unannotated-00513	Porters  were  all lovely and greeted us with a smile.
en-unannotated-00514	He seemed like quite a jolly character!
en-unannotated-00515	Spend 5-10 minutes waiting to find a driver only for it to tell you none are available.
en-unannotated-00516	The place operates out of a converted shipping container (hence the name) but the quality is outstanding.
en-unannotated-00517	It is the best place we have eaten at during our time here in Europe!
en-unannotated-00518	Delicious toast with eggplant.
en-unannotated-00519	It was loud and we received no sleep.
en-unannotated-00520	I tried hers and liked it much more than mine, but that's not to say mine wasn't good.
en-unannotated-00521	When the maître' d noticed we...
en-unannotated-00522	Nearly missed our pre-booked tour of Rome due to this incident.
en-unannotated-00523	It's harder 2 navigate compared to the pc version.
en-unannotated-00524	Obviously the price of this 5-star hotel is quite high.
en-unannotated-00525	However, we weren't disappointed with what we had ordered.
en-unannotated-00526	I don't know whether it's some kind of a bug or not but while starting a tournament my opponent automatically wins without even starting the match...
en-unannotated-00527	Visit Cafe Pushkin it's like going to the 19th century with modern twist and hundreds of years of culinary knowledge.
en-unannotated-00528	The pork knuckle looked awesome and I will definitely try it next time!
en-unannotated-00529	The cheese was tasteless.
en-unannotated-00530	Very good food and service.
en-unannotated-00531	Bijou, modern rooms in an old building and within walking distance of all the major tourist sights.
en-unannotated-00532	Not because the cab ride there took an hour, not only because the duck was superb, not even because of the low prices, but because of the amazing hospitality and service.
en-unannotated-00533	I could write a whole book about how the place looks and how is put together.
en-unannotated-00534	Quiet, spacious room (109). Incredible shower.
en-unannotated-00535	For English only speakers the...
en-unannotated-00536	The are quintessential description of my motto
en-unannotated-00537	Certainly more upscale than your average Pinxto bar, but still a warm and inviting place with friendly and unpretentious service.
en-unannotated-00538	I enjoyed the mid week degustation menu on another visit with wines - slightly smaller than I hoped for and the wine selection was not very nice (all from QLD) Would of been good to see some South Australian and Margaret River Wines, also wines are not a full standard glass as they pour under the standard fill line on every course - this was annoying
en-unannotated-00539	A minor detail, but just wanted to mention it for the more budget conscious travelers out there!
en-unannotated-00540	He was super helpful in explaining their menu to me.
en-unannotated-00541	After 4 requests, we were eventually moved.
en-unannotated-00542	Minus points.
en-unannotated-00543	This is a great local establishment which we will visit again.
en-unannotated-00544	Well designed premium hotel with nicely appointed rooms and good service.
en-unannotated-00545	Rome accessories was so cheep .
en-unannotated-00546	I can only recommend...
en-unannotated-00547	Fabulous location very close to Piazza Navona.
en-unannotated-00548	i want my coins back.
en-unannotated-00549	but besides that,the food was excellent and looked ravishing as well.
en-unannotated-00550	Also, it is close to other places to enjoy gelato and even hookah.
en-unannotated-00551	Poor clarity in the rooms
en-unannotated-00552	Like intense flavor bomb, but it was a bit too much for us.
en-unannotated-00553	Great hotel, modern amenities and the rooms are in an excellent condition, very comfortable.
en-unannotated-00554	Seems like a popular for the locals, we came around 12 noon and by 12:30 it was full.
en-unannotated-00555	Make your reservations people!
en-unannotated-00556	My friend ordered the seared duck breast a that was really tasty as well.
en-unannotated-00557	Would come back - big room and great value for money.
en-unannotated-00558	We arrived and everyone from the entrance of the hotel to the front desk was amazing!
en-unannotated-00559	Television has both English and Spanish channels.
en-unannotated-00560	It's a lot of food but...
en-unannotated-00561	Dare I say it was life changing?
en-unannotated-00562	However, the food is nothing to rave about.
en-unannotated-00563	Exquisite decor, every small detail is being taken care off.
en-unannotated-00564	One block from the old town and 100m from the bus to the airport.
en-unannotated-00565	A case of you get what you pay for.
en-unannotated-00566	They release an update yet the main purpose of the app is gone!!
en-unannotated-00567	I try to go there once a year for my anniversary.
en-unannotated-00568	I even cleared my cache and uninstalled the game and reinstalled it.
en-unannotated-00569	it is located in Old Town of the city and had a reservation thru the hotel Astoria7 reception, thanks to them for their advice, where had so good delicious dishes and left with good feelings.
en-unannotated-00570	It is humongous and amazing!
en-unannotated-00571	But in a hot day,...
en-unannotated-00572	Price is extremely fair for a hotel of this nature.
en-unannotated-00573	From the moment we arrived everything about this experience was set to be unforgettable.
en-unannotated-00574	The rooms are nicely sized, with some wear and tear but generally in great condition.
en-unannotated-00575	Lovely setting, great service, deliciously compiled dishes and exciting wines.
en-unannotated-00576	We thoroughly enjoyed [name]’s Aromatic Spring Menu and the EatWith experience at his apartment.
en-unannotated-00577	And so good!!
en-unannotated-00578	Get in there.
en-unannotated-00579	The building is an 18th century palace, that has been completely restored.
en-unannotated-00580	Just amazing simple place.
en-unannotated-00581	Lovely tapas.
en-unannotated-00582	I got Soundcloud because I could listen to (not download) music for free.
en-unannotated-00583	Comfortable bed and pillows which in my opinion is the most important thing when choosing a hotel
en-unannotated-00584	Vegetables can never go wrong.
en-unannotated-00585	Since we arrived, they greeted us with a smile.
en-unannotated-00586	Now, this IS pasta and this IS a real sauce.
en-unannotated-00587	To put it bluntly, the server basically stated that "this is the way French people eat it."
en-unannotated-00588	The bread was also very tasty and crunchy.
en-unannotated-00589	The final, infused drink smelled and tasted amazing.
en-unannotated-00590	My friends and I had a reservation, a must for this restaurant, and were greeted and seated by lovely, attentive waiters who made you feel welcome without overwhelming you.
en-unannotated-00591	KINDLY IMPROVE ON THIS FORTAFY GAMES!
en-unannotated-00592	It was difficult to hear dinner conversations and not very comfortable sitting spitting distance from strangers, albeit elegantly dressed ones.
en-unannotated-00593	The plates were all a cut above the usual fare in the area.
en-unannotated-00594	Excellent place.
en-unannotated-00595	even without the cheese the way we ordered it.
en-unannotated-00596	Have fun!
en-unannotated-00597	You will not be disapointed with the delicious breakfast and delicious coffe in the hotel restaurant.
en-unannotated-00598	In fact I'd go as far as to say it's the best chicken burger I've had!
en-unannotated-00599	Anyways, I decided to split a 36 euro menu with one of my friends to try all the food.
en-unannotated-00600	The wait staff was attentive without being over bearing.
en-unannotated-00601	Good Hotel , not in City center but close to other offcies.
en-unannotated-00602	Highlights - very friendly staff, free buffet from midday until late.
en-unannotated-00603	They loved everything and anything on the menu!
en-unannotated-00604	I would never stay there again or recommend it to anyone.
en-unannotated-00605	When we were done I had to tell them how special the meal was and how we appreciated the service.
en-unannotated-00606	Food was good but nothing amazing.
en-unannotated-00607	you don't even like duck that much.
en-unannotated-00608	The Colombian hot dogs are really good..
en-unannotated-00609	The website claims there is a pool - but doesn't state it's only open 15 June to sept.
en-unannotated-00610	Fitting right into Brisbane's cafe scene, this cafe by day and bar by night is one part rustic one part era.
en-unannotated-00611	this hotel is a very nice hotel with comfortable lobby and clean rooms.
en-unannotated-00612	It did take a while but it was well worth the wait.
en-unannotated-00613	Food was just okay.
en-unannotated-00614	Everything we wanted for our first meal in Prague!
en-unannotated-00615	I didn't need the cake, but they rolled out that dessert cart and it looked too good to pass up!
en-unannotated-00616	Suffice it to say however, if you fancy a very good meal in the heart of the Trinity College section of Dublin for a price that will not lighten your wallet too much, The Farm is certainly worthy of consideration.
en-unannotated-00617	haha
en-unannotated-00618	Located nearby the beach and town center
en-unannotated-00619	We found this while searching online for the best food experiences in Corsica and we were NOT disappointed.
en-unannotated-00620	I usually play the second option of the game,  and in online part the snake is not moves smoothly.
en-unannotated-00621	Great location two mins walk from the Metro.
en-unannotated-00622	Everything was good up until this point...
en-unannotated-00623	It has everything going for it that makes it one of my new favorite places to eat in Paris!
en-unannotated-00624	The duck was cooked a perfect medium rare and the scallops were oh-so-flavorful served in a light vanilla cream sauce with a nice veggie succotash.
en-unannotated-00625	We also started with the soup of he day and seafood chowder and those were just as amazing.
en-unannotated-00626	Perfectly formed tiny restaurant where everything is done with real love.
en-unannotated-00627	For example, no washing powder for the washing machine, 1 dishwasher tablet left, no spare toilet paper, many lights not working.
en-unannotated-00628	The younger gentleman was not to blame.
en-unannotated-00629	Probably better than standard Irish pub food, but I am back in USA as I write this, so just OK.
en-unannotated-00630	The roof terrass was nice but the prices were extremely high.
en-unannotated-00631	Le Meridien Mexico City was top notch & a great place to stay.
en-unannotated-00632	Was decent Italian in a basement cave kinda place.
en-unannotated-00633	One of better meals in The Czech Republic.
en-unannotated-00634	Hands down one of the most interesting and delicious experiences I've ever had.
en-unannotated-00635	Very comfy bed
en-unannotated-00636	After all was said and done, our bill was nothing to complain about; for all that we ordered and considering how high of quality the food was, I'd say it was a steal.
en-unannotated-00637	great boutique hotel and you get the feeling a lot of thought went into every little detail.
en-unannotated-00638	We had literally ordered over 50 Euros worth of food, and they tried starving us to death.
en-unannotated-00639	This was our favorite meal in Paris!
en-unannotated-00640	I visited here with my mother, and we both had delicious meals!
en-unannotated-00641	The menu is in English and the waiters can speak English which is always nice.
en-unannotated-00642	Again excellent.
en-unannotated-00643	The door to Uma is just a wooden door with a doorbell, but when you go in it opens into a beautiful minimal white dining room that seats 12. At the end Iker busies away getting your meal ready.
en-unannotated-00644	Excellent food, service and ambience.
en-unannotated-00645	Every year it is a pleasure celebrating my wife's birthday with the superb food and care of this great restaurant.
en-unannotated-00646	Best meal in Paris, hands down.
en-unannotated-00647	You have to pay for pressing which they charged us 68 euros for 5 items which we argued.
en-unannotated-00648	My friends and I had a wonderful meal here -- very filling and all the dishes were tasty, from the starters to the main courses.
en-unannotated-00649	The staff weren't very friendly and were pretty cold.
en-unannotated-00650	The two women, mother and daughter I think, have recreated an Italian kitchen from the 50's/60's.
en-unannotated-00651	The food was mediocre and so was the service.
en-unannotated-00652	There is only one disadvantage, it is not very centric.
en-unannotated-00653	Also, this restaurant is very inexpensive compared to others.
en-unannotated-00654	However....
en-unannotated-00655	I expect much more from a 5 star
en-unannotated-00656	I wish I could give 6 stars!
en-unannotated-00657	No fan in bathroom
en-unannotated-00658	Klaw Poke offered a tiny dollop of pretty bland lobster roll in a small brioche bun - pretty disappointing.
en-unannotated-00659	I've been to both and they're both fantastic.
en-unannotated-00660	If you are visiting Prague its worth putting on your list to visit even if you are not a foodie.
en-unannotated-00661	The elevators need to have a face lift as they are dated.
en-unannotated-00662	The hotel employees were very accommodating.
en-unannotated-00663	Other than that,very fun,but challenging game
en-unannotated-00664	Disapointed that no refrigerator or microwave in room.
en-unannotated-00665	They don't open until 7:30 (which coming from the USA I thought was late). When we got to the restaurant a few minutes after 7:30 [NAME] told us we had to finish by 8:30 because they needed the table at that time.
en-unannotated-00666	So much so that we came back a second night to try another entree.
en-unannotated-00667	So much that the neighboring couple ordered the same dish
en-unannotated-00668	Got the meatballs for starters which were delicious and amongst the best ive ever had but then tried the foie gras which i did not like at all, though this might have been down to me having never tried it before.
en-unannotated-00669	Risoelatte I love you!
en-unannotated-00670	We loved the gratins since we both love cheese very much.
en-unannotated-00671	And perfectly located...
en-unannotated-00672	Excellent walks.
en-unannotated-00673	The tomato and cheese is really good but I think without the pesto sauce and more of a balsamic and oil would of been better.
en-unannotated-00674	The waiter was the best!
en-unannotated-00675	I would recommend it to anybody.
en-unannotated-00676	We managed to get a table for our group without a fuss and without a prior booking.
en-unannotated-00677	Love the gnocchi and cottoletta yummmm
en-unannotated-00678	I've had better breakfasts at a quality inn or comfort inn.
en-unannotated-00679	Far to slow.
en-unannotated-00680	Very nice but basic.
en-unannotated-00681	Room service is fast and tasty.
en-unannotated-00682	The location is very central.
en-unannotated-00683	What can I say, firstly the waitress was the nicest and most friendly...
en-unannotated-00684	Still getting used to the single beds pushed together butwho cares when you get a good nites sleep.
en-unannotated-00685	Very nice food and service.
en-unannotated-00686	Other things on the menu that are good that my friends had: escargot & beef stew.
en-unannotated-00687	Good new rooms.
en-unannotated-00688	Inside the Gogol house was Granvillano Cafe, small but quaintly decorated.
en-unannotated-00689	The staff was very helpful and very pleasant.
en-unannotated-00690	Casual atmosphere with excellent service and attention to detail.
en-unannotated-00691	Could stop asking for g+ creation on every initial sync but mostly just wishing every app in store used this more.
en-unannotated-00692	only thing is i ran out of coins , and they have these offers if you subscribe to something or get netflix , download apps , ect.
en-unannotated-00693	The Drury hotels are one of my favorites...
en-unannotated-00694	Bus station was a pleasant 20 minutes walk away.
en-unannotated-00695	The food was ok at best.
en-unannotated-00696	His sauces were heavenly and the meat was cooked perfectly.
en-unannotated-00697	the lamb was a strange cut, so while most parts were cooked as required (medium), some parts were overdone, and the chef failed to cut off a few bits of gristle.
en-unannotated-00698	Try to book a table for dinner, they will spoil you :)
en-unannotated-00699	The pintxos are great!
en-unannotated-00700	With my Pixel phone I can back up all my pics and vids for free at full resolution!
en-unannotated-00701	From the moment we arrived we felt welcomed and that continued throughout the stay.
en-unannotated-00702	) the sauces.
en-unannotated-00703	Classic resto in downtown moscow.
en-unannotated-00704	The breakfast although expensive offers a wide variety of options.
en-unannotated-00705	We were not disappointed.
en-unannotated-00706	Given all the amazing reviews I expected way more from this restaurant.
en-unannotated-00707	Housekeeping always pleased us during our stay.
en-unannotated-00708	This would get 3.5 stars from me.
en-unannotated-00709	The list of flavors is outside of...
en-unannotated-00710	and wow we had dinner...
en-unannotated-00711	First had a rather dusty and worn out room including matress...
en-unannotated-00712	I had a pasta with lobster and it was fresh and delicious.
en-unannotated-00713	The atmosphere is very cute and cozy.
en-unannotated-00714	This time I ordered the seasonal starter (white asparagus) and salmon with beetroot sauce.
en-unannotated-00715	View from window on the building in 3 meters against window.
en-unannotated-00716	I guess that should be expected though since the beer is from the Czech Republic, but I was still very happy.
en-unannotated-00717	Location: Brew is tucked in an alley way on Lower Burnett Lane, to the left of 7 Eleven.
en-unannotated-00718	This was the best dining experience during our week in Paris.
en-unannotated-00719	If you get water, it will have lemon and refreshing mint leaves.
en-unannotated-00720	Went there last night as a couple.
en-unannotated-00721	Try the sirloin steak with foie, it's delicious!
en-unannotated-00722	They brought the wrong appetizer, and it took 3 attempts with two different waiters...
en-unannotated-00723	you won't regret the visit!
en-unannotated-00724	Overall, a great place - I'd love to be back!
en-unannotated-00725	It definitely made my experience so much better.
en-unannotated-00726	I love this game.
en-unannotated-00727	Tried various applications to transfer but with no success.
en-unannotated-00728	Really not a bad place - a traditional cafeteria with traditional Soviet food.
en-unannotated-00729	The salad was ok, nothing special about it.
en-unannotated-00730	It was also very disorganized inside, and we were standing on the wrong line up until we finally spoke to someone at the counter.
en-unannotated-00731	The ensuite shower is also difficult to operate.
en-unannotated-00732	We were told there is no option of tap water, only paid beverages.
en-unannotated-00733	We saw many people come to Den Noc at about midday and there was a line out the door by the time we started eating, and people waiting outside.
en-unannotated-00734	We were lucky enough to get in as tourists in late September.
en-unannotated-00735	Well, it's so dimlighted that it always has the cozy factor I guess.
en-unannotated-00736	I really love this game.
en-unannotated-00737	I didn't think you could have Foie overload...
en-unannotated-00738	Was game of war for  145,000 coins.
en-unannotated-00739	I typically eat beef and potatoes but this had a bunch of veggies and mushrooms in it too.
en-unannotated-00740	Nice Bar.
en-unannotated-00741	I am so glad that I discovered Brew while in Brisbane!
en-unannotated-00742	Even the cheap restaurants of Madrid are fantastic so obviously imagined this fine dining high class restaurant wouldnt dissapoint.
en-unannotated-00743	Ummmm...
en-unannotated-00744	The "Barbacoa" "Fideo Seco Soup", and the "Chile Relleno from Oaxaca" are my favorite dishes.
en-unannotated-00745	would definitely recommend this restaurant
en-unannotated-00746	- duck breast: 3.5/5. The duck was cooked perfectly but the sauce was too sweet for a dinner plate
en-unannotated-00747	I was very impressed with the Hilton hotel in Sante Fe (Mexico City). Our experience was very positive.
en-unannotated-00748	Such a perfect dessert made for sharing.
en-unannotated-00749	People invite you to sit if no open tables.
en-unannotated-00750	Have to say that the service and food was some of the best we've ever had.
en-unannotated-00751	It is not just an excellent restaurant like many others, it has an additional sparkle.
en-unannotated-00752	Awesome pub.
en-unannotated-00753	Thank you for making this a highlight of the trip.
en-unannotated-00754	We ordered the dry-aged cheeseburger, the 3 different types of sausage platter, and the meatloaf.
en-unannotated-00755	We were a group of 5 girls looking for an authentic spot to eat dinner our first night in Milan.
en-unannotated-00756	I spent only two nights and for business purposes.
en-unannotated-00757	Very good.
en-unannotated-00758	both of them are amazing.
en-unannotated-00759	The room carpets were old and no tea coffee ketttle in the room.
en-unannotated-00760	-Dry-aged hamburger
en-unannotated-00761	Internal decor generally stunning.
en-unannotated-00762	Good location BUT The Hotel is overrated for a five star hotel.
en-unannotated-00763	The service was great and the beer was very good.
en-unannotated-00764	Could have easily had 5-7 people sleep in the room with the large l-shaped couch.
en-unannotated-00765	We could not have enough of it.
en-unannotated-00766	Great location, customer service, quality of room, great black out in room, very good breakfast.
en-unannotated-00767	Hah!
en-unannotated-00768	Scores of passerby gawking in amazement, like a bunch of vultures staring at a dead corpse.
en-unannotated-00769	I just wish they would add a lactose free option to the bottles iced coffee and mocha range.
en-unannotated-00770	The cider house part of Verve's name is no lie with an impressive list of over 50 ciders, sorted from very sweet to very dry.
en-unannotated-00771	Can't recommend it enough.
en-unannotated-00772	Chartuterie aka assort.
en-unannotated-00773	So what's a boxty?
en-unannotated-00774	So glad this was the place I chose.
en-unannotated-00775	He doubled as busser, barista, dish washer, host, picked up all the calls, linguist, etc etc.
en-unannotated-00776	But we got a table for 90 min!
en-unannotated-00777	For the last night of our vacation we chose comfort, luxury and pampering.
en-unannotated-00778	Clunky, clunky, clunky.
en-unannotated-00779	The staff were really friendly and helped translate and recommend menu items.
en-unannotated-00780	The blueberry beer is a must try.
en-unannotated-00781	I was served by two different people who were both professional, courteous and attentive.
en-unannotated-00782	I have since ordered it every single time.
en-unannotated-00783	Here goes...
en-unannotated-00784	The sauce was delicious.
en-unannotated-00785	Sidenote: I saw a lot of people just come and go for a drink or two.
en-unannotated-00786	Andrea is really great guy and a true fan of the business!
en-unannotated-00787	With growing horror, I realized the whole restaurant was decorated like with Mussolini quotes, busts, photos, etc.
en-unannotated-00788	Food looked delicious too
en-unannotated-00789	I had the "landais" gratin which contained thin slicked duck breast, goat cheese, potatoes (duh), rosemary, and an egg.
en-unannotated-00790	In a city that is full of Japanese eateries it can be difficult to find a standout, but it has been found.
en-unannotated-00791	The food was superb!
en-unannotated-00792	We would definitely love to visit again.
en-unannotated-00793	Will buy this game in future and won't hold my breath waiting for price to drop,because that won't happen.
en-unannotated-00794	I'm on a Samsung S7 with T-Mobile network and have tried uninstalling and reinstalling but the problem persists.
en-unannotated-00795	Inside the elevators are little bit smelly.
en-unannotated-00796	Super slow service!
en-unannotated-00797	a lot of meat options and traditional Czech options along with great beer....
en-unannotated-00798	We left hungry.
en-unannotated-00799	A must stop for Brisbane!
en-unannotated-00800	Loly was a delight.
en-unannotated-00801	Our room was an attic room and it was beautiful and spacious.
en-unannotated-00802	I think it's important to understand that this is first and foremost a chocolate shop, that also has a few tables where you can enjoy a limited menus of deserts or some cocoa.
en-unannotated-00803	The food was tasty and we were pleased to have eventually eaten there.
en-unannotated-00804	Service was quick and nice, and I had a lovely conversation with the waitress about the book I was reading.
en-unannotated-00805	Once you save the princess,only the rally's are left and when you unlock all items,then what?
en-unannotated-00806	We arrived for food on a Wednesday and ate off the early bird.
en-unannotated-00807	And also do try the local beer served here!
en-unannotated-00808	We tried just about all the different tacos on the menu, the seafood is very fresh and the portions are large.
en-unannotated-00809	Definitely going back!
en-unannotated-00810	And we travel at many levels from winging it to lux.
en-unannotated-00811	Booked for a birthday lunch as a treat and from the moment we arrived to the moment we left nothing disapointed.
en-unannotated-00812	We were told they were dry-aged, but unfortunately the communication barrier prevented us from asking more.
en-unannotated-00813	Had the Irish version of bacon and cabbage with mashed potatoes.
en-unannotated-00814	They offer high quality meat, and cooked items as well.
en-unannotated-00815	The hotel is located next to the Retiro Park, 250 m from Puerta de Alcala.
en-unannotated-00816	Location fantastic, walking distance to all sites including Vatican.
en-unannotated-00817	Everything seemed very fresh, and was reasonably priced.
en-unannotated-00818	Easy to navigate to in Temple Bar District.
en-unannotated-00819	Good place with middle prices, even...
en-unannotated-00820	We mentioned this to hotel staff, ants dissapeared, however the next day they appeared again.
en-unannotated-00821	And with a My Nintendo account you can earn silver points for in-game feats, so link your accounts, everyone!
en-unannotated-00822	Incredible staff, super cool rooms, amazing breakfast.
en-unannotated-00823	(It was also close to my hotel.)
en-unannotated-00824	Rubbish don't ever download this app
en-unannotated-00825	We walked everywhere and loved the vibes of this energetic area.
en-unannotated-00826	Tried to get a table by walking in but had to make a reservation for the next day (which luckily had availability). Run by Chef Hugo with his nephew Jeremy serving as host, the experience is intimate and unique.
en-unannotated-00827	modern and comfortable interior are great!
en-unannotated-00828	The burgers are huge and flavorful.
en-unannotated-00829	google play music continues playing even when it's closed.
en-unannotated-00830	They are just flat-out good.
en-unannotated-00831	Unreal.
en-unannotated-00832	- Wifi in the rooms is very bad.
en-unannotated-00833	As soon as you arrive you are attended to with help and directions to the check in area.
en-unannotated-00834	Thank god for yelp.
en-unannotated-00835	Though my wife is not particularly into western food, she enjoys the food and the wine there.
en-unannotated-00836	The restaurant serves generous and flavoursome dishes with local products.
en-unannotated-00837	Sheesh!
en-unannotated-00838	Pleeeease fix this as i love snapchat.
en-unannotated-00839	Great location and design of the hotel.
en-unannotated-00840	Accompanied by an almost even better mango ice cream.
en-unannotated-00841	Congratulations
en-unannotated-00842	We came here with the ambition to have a good choclate cake.
en-unannotated-00843	I had what my server recommended, a beef and potato dumpling dish that came with a raspberry cream.
en-unannotated-00844	All good, nothing bad.
en-unannotated-00845	After our guide point this fine place out to us, we were able to enjoy the daily menu, which will be a highlight of a two week trip.
en-unannotated-00846	Was extremely hot when we were there, no AC, tables so small they need to bring a stool to put the food on.
en-unannotated-00847	The good ambiance.
en-unannotated-00848	Visited last weekend on a flying stop in Paris city, met with an old friend.
en-unannotated-00849	The boutique sells pastries and hot chocolate to go.
en-unannotated-00850	Gracias
en-unannotated-00851	In the lobby area there is very little palatial left.
en-unannotated-00852	Food is good but not amazing.
en-unannotated-00853	To start [NAME] had the prawn risotto and I went with the goat cheese salad.
en-unannotated-00854	Being an engineer I enjoyed uncovering old survey pages of Albert St inserted in the drink menu.
en-unannotated-00855	They also have wi-fi, which is awesome if you're traveling and just want to check up on emails or social media.
en-unannotated-00856	Too pretentious for its own good.
en-unannotated-00857	The food, ambiance and service are flawless.
en-unannotated-00858	It feels surreal.
en-unannotated-00859	Wow!
en-unannotated-00860	The ambience is straight forward but the waiters and captains make it a great experience....
en-unannotated-00861	I just hope when I return to Paris that I'll actually get a table.
en-unannotated-00862	Then once you get to where you can decorate your own spinner you can keep watching ad's as long as you want.
en-unannotated-00863	we recently stayed here on a Sat night- on a last minute RSVP....
en-unannotated-00864	There was plenty of bottled water available and apples every where.
en-unannotated-00865	The hotel is well situated & well converted from a 16th Century chapel
en-unannotated-00866	What is a Boxty you ask?
en-unannotated-00867	The Buffalo mozzarella was as good as the specialty shops and the pizza, while a bit soggy, delivered on flavor.
en-unannotated-00868	Definitely an experience to remember for the right reasons.
en-unannotated-00869	Although, they were American tourists, like us.
en-unannotated-00870	Room was kept clean and with a comfortable bed.
en-unannotated-00871	We came here because we wanted authentic Italian food-- we were not let down!
en-unannotated-00872	Goulash in a loaf of bread and Czech desserts.
en-unannotated-00873	It's is a life-changing pasta, really.
en-unannotated-00874	I wish I also had the opportunity to try the cinnamon and banana version.
en-unannotated-00875	A couple of tasting menus with popular options cater for those who cannot choose from the mammoth array of food on offer.
en-unannotated-00876	The buffet was great however the menu was the same everyday.
en-unannotated-00877	You can chat with friends (and hear the conversation), talk to the bar tenders and really get to know what their favourite drinks are.
en-unannotated-00878	Also, could not find the crockery in the apartment until we were leaving - not in an obvious spot, and we were not shown on arrival.
en-unannotated-00879	Your attitude is repugnant.
en-unannotated-00880	The manager showed other rooms that are much nicer but it seems when you book thru booking.
en-unannotated-00881	Cafe by day, bar by night!
en-unannotated-00882	[name] and [name] really took care of us and we had a wonderful lunch at the Market.
en-unannotated-00883	Yelp brought us here on a Thursday night, where all tables for the entire night were sold out.
en-unannotated-00884	Part of a six man stag weekend and this place was bar far the best we visited
en-unannotated-00885	-Beer: you're given cups and it's self-serve!
en-unannotated-00886	Spent a full day walking the city and was looking for some good food for dinner.
en-unannotated-00887	There were no seats.
en-unannotated-00888	Drinks were great.
en-unannotated-00889	Would definitely stay again.
en-unannotated-00890	App refuses to load short cut to device.
en-unannotated-00891	They have an outside balcony overlooking...
en-unannotated-00892	Just perfect, especially those: earl grey and raspberry, passion fruit, lemon.
en-unannotated-00893	Within a few minutes, the hall was about half full and there was a decent bustle of ambient noise.
en-unannotated-00894	Chic ancient building, service was charming and super fast.
en-unannotated-00895	But from past few days, I'm not able to cast or find Chromecast from my mobile which is used as hotspot.
en-unannotated-00896	This is a really fun bar with what looks like 100 different flavored rums (all infused right there) that can be concocted into any combination cocktail.
en-unannotated-00897	I chose to sit under the covered patio.
en-unannotated-00898	The Potato with Caviar might...
en-unannotated-00899	We tried for the first time the foie gras...
en-unannotated-00900	It was even better than I remembered from my last visit.
en-unannotated-00901	I just could not get over the smell but...
en-unannotated-00902	We ordered a couple of glasses of local white wine, and the...
en-unannotated-00903	Tucked in a hide-away lane near Queens Mall, it offers a surprising ambiance with it's industrial styled fit outs.
en-unannotated-00904	We ordered our drinks and they put them on a table and then you go up and order your tacos,...
en-unannotated-00905	Both dishes had a blend of tastes out of this world, and we have been to high end Italian restaurants before.
en-unannotated-00906	I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone!
en-unannotated-00907	TV in the room is not working!
en-unannotated-00908	We have had a great evening at the Ástor with fantastic food and cocktails.
en-unannotated-00909	This nice and new hotel located just steps from La Castellana.
en-unannotated-00910	Breakfast very good.
en-unannotated-00911	5). Great value.
en-unannotated-00912	Today I took my morning break to coincide with opening time at 11am as I didn't want to wait in their rather long opening week lines, even at 11.01 there were 5 people in front of me and about 8 behind me!
en-unannotated-00913	The restaurant resembles a cafeteria with many long tables (marked reserved!) going back and back and back.
en-unannotated-00914	) and we left stuffed!
en-unannotated-00915	I visit Brisbane on a monthly basis at the moment, and Verve is always a good option for a quick simple and tasty meal with a nice glass of cider.
en-unannotated-00916	It was REALLY COLD outside which made it hard to enjoy the food so we ate pretty fast and were done by the time the cheeseburgers came out.
en-unannotated-00917	We are glad we did as the food was great.
en-unannotated-00918	I would not recommend this restaurant with all the options available in Mexico...
en-unannotated-00919	To go with the theme for the evening of having Czech food, we went with a traditional Czech strudel filled with plums and poppy seed, served with vanilla ice cream.
en-unannotated-00920	Maybe I ordered the wrong thing.
en-unannotated-00921	clean rooms and very friendly staff.
en-unannotated-00922	It is a lovely refugee from the busy city, it is a newly renovated boutique hotel located within a short walking distance of all the downtown historical sites.
en-unannotated-00923	We reviewed comments and were a little concerned that there had been some adverse comments in the last week or so .
en-unannotated-00924	Very impressed!
en-unannotated-00925	This is the perfect Milanese restaurant that leaves a lasting impression on its guests.
en-unannotated-00926	we must be fans!
en-unannotated-00927	Friendly & helpful staff.
en-unannotated-00928	Someday more hotels will do things this way.
en-unannotated-00929	Sashimi delight!
en-unannotated-00930	I had the Asparagus Risotto and liked it, but didn't love the chunky pieces of vegetable in there.
en-unannotated-00931	I had the chocolate lava cake, which was good, and my husband had the special, with roasted peaches and lavender.
en-unannotated-00932	Delicious churrus and cheap one
en-unannotated-00933	Ever.
en-unannotated-00934	The lady who runs the restaurant is very kind and helpful, and ready...
en-unannotated-00935	I have been coming to P Macs since it has opened, and love their wide selection of beer.
en-unannotated-00936	A flashback to a childhood memory sitting at my grandparents table with my feet hanging from the chair.
en-unannotated-00937	We had a great night here last year - top notch food, service, ambiance.
en-unannotated-00938	Greatly recomended.
en-unannotated-00939	Love this app, play it every chance I get but it won't let me add my friends?
en-unannotated-00940	Yes we washed it down with Pivo in true Czech fashion.
en-unannotated-00941	If you have a sensitive nose as I do, then I recommend visiting Pelko after you've already got a couple of pints under your belt and your tolerance to really poor smelling venues has become less sensitive.
en-unannotated-00942	The restaurant has truly amazing food with very kind waiters...
en-unannotated-00943	Hotel is very new and rooms are comfortable and modern.
en-unannotated-00944	If you are near, give it a try...
en-unannotated-00945	Not in a huge rush to visit again.
en-unannotated-00946	Just point to the things you want, the guys behind the counter will heat up or grill whatever is needed.
en-unannotated-00947	Suddenly u bring such a drastic change.
en-unannotated-00948	From the first course to the last, the flavors and presentation are like nowhere else.
en-unannotated-00949	the bath room: is little- but it probably depends from the old structure - the light was too low and there is not a courtesy mirror.
en-unannotated-00950	It is in a great location as well.
en-unannotated-00951	Hard to communicate with the renting company.
en-unannotated-00952	It's real meat, without that sea of acid tomato sauce.
en-unannotated-00953	Please make it faster!
en-unannotated-00954	Although it is newly built because of popularity that arose from Aznavour's song Natalie, Cafe Puskin is beautiful place.
en-unannotated-00955	It was succulent, juicy and perfection on a plate.
en-unannotated-00956	But sucks u only get 3 levels.
en-unannotated-00957	For the extremely hungry or small groups is the humorously named section "Life's Challenges" which consists of a rotating special "Death Row Meal", today's was a whole ham hock, a tin of Don Bocarte anchovies and a whole duck of the day.
en-unannotated-00958	well worth a visit
en-unannotated-00959	Beautiful room, clean and comfortable.
en-unannotated-00960	Cheap beers and great food!
en-unannotated-00961	Working great now!!
en-unannotated-00962	Please fix.
en-unannotated-00963	We got a table right next to one of the big windows, with amazing views of the city.
en-unannotated-00964	The cuisine was very refined with complex flavours and good presentation.
en-unannotated-00965	The company was good and conversation flowed well.
en-unannotated-00966	Delicious!
en-unannotated-00967	Breakfast is OK, no more, no less.
en-unannotated-00968	waitstaff and family-run management are rightfully proud of this unique spot.
en-unannotated-00969	The staff are very friendly and most of them speak English.
en-unannotated-00970	They also have a small shop inside if you're interested in buying foie gras to take home.
en-unannotated-00971	Starting with a soup and followed by main course and desert including a drink this is all one vegan needs for lunch.
en-unannotated-00972	The room was clean, the bathroom had an elevated platform shower so the water did not accumulate on your feet, which I liked.
en-unannotated-00973	Very pleasant place with tables in the terrace outside.
en-unannotated-00974	I ate here at lunch instead of dinner as it was on my way back to my hotel from the South Bank.
en-unannotated-00975	I don't think i've ever stayed anywhere in the world where the detail was so impeccable, impressive, attentive...
en-unannotated-00976	They gave us prosecco with bread, sun dried tomatoes and meat balls for starters!
en-unannotated-00977	A real Paris gem.
en-unannotated-00978	Make sure to make a reservation.
en-unannotated-00979	Shucks who cares, I had been in a plane for 30 hrs.....
en-unannotated-00980	Don't try to find another one.
en-unannotated-00981	The fitness room is also more expansive and well equipped than most Hiltons and has a single lane lap pool, which was a big plus.
en-unannotated-00982	Food reasonably priced and all had English & Russian labels.
en-unannotated-00983	Clean.
en-unannotated-00984	Plus u can trap BIGGER snakes than YOU!!
en-unannotated-00985	There was so much moist, tender meat that I could only eat half.
en-unannotated-00986	My goat cheese salad and soup were served with bread and the cutest jug of cold water.
en-unannotated-00987	bar rather quiet.
en-unannotated-00988	Very simple premise!
en-unannotated-00989	It's on a very lovely place in Corte and I hope I will go back to have more drinks eventually.
en-unannotated-00990	Easy 8.5/10. Point deducted for the bun being dry.
en-unannotated-00991	they could squeeze us in...
en-unannotated-00992	Rich, dense and produced from the finest stock.
en-unannotated-00993	Margaritas were made from fresh lime juice, strained to remove pulp, served in glasses that a bartender took special care to shake salt upon, and even lime wedges that garnished the glass were adjusted until they were *just right*.
en-unannotated-00994	L'Abeille is definitely fine dining, but there is such a respect for the guests and desire to make sure the experience is special, which it was.
en-unannotated-00995	Definitely worth a visit.
en-unannotated-00996	The service is friendly and efficient and...
en-unannotated-00997	Bathroom was ok, except for the shower curtain.
en-unannotated-00998	If you go to Paris and don't come here then don't go home
en-unannotated-00999	Very good killed the entire plate.
en-unannotated-01000	I have never had a tasting menu that I enjoyed so thoroughly.
en-unannotated-01001	Stairwell emergency lighting only on two floors (our room was on the fourth floor). Not able to shower and get ready for the day.
en-unannotated-01002	Instead, what I recommend is to wait at the back area with all of the standing customers who are also waiting.
en-unannotated-01003	The staff was wonderful – they were very helpful and warm.
en-unannotated-01004	We selected the tariff menu which was absolutely superb.
en-unannotated-01005	We first enter by pressing the door button.
en-unannotated-01006	The restaurant and in room dining had extremely limited vegetarian options.
en-unannotated-01007	The only complaint I have is that opening the black out curtain required a lot of effort.
en-unannotated-01008	There are only about 7 stools along the counter so getting a seat is a matter of luck and/or patience.
en-unannotated-01009	The menu is pretty pricey, but if you go in with that in mind (and check the prices on the website beforehand), it's fine.
en-unannotated-01010	We ended up at this hotel in a bit of a crisis as we could not get into our appartment.
en-unannotated-01011	The room was designed to feel like you were in an old Italian building with the iconic architecture that you expect to find in Rome, yet it was very modern in all of the amenities.
en-unannotated-01012	wow.
en-unannotated-01013	The last time we wanted to check this place out was my birthday and it was fully booked.
en-unannotated-01014	Can't watch keeps saying error don't know what's you going on
en-unannotated-01015	We were happy with our choice to stay at Atton Bogota.
en-unannotated-01016	My friend and I stopped here for breakfast.
en-unannotated-01017	Be prepared to make new friends during dinner!
en-unannotated-01018	We will definitely be staying here again for next year's tournament.
en-unannotated-01019	Wide choice of Menu all fresh food.
en-unannotated-01020	A waiter handed me a map and the Mlejnice business card for their new Žatecka restaurant which is across Old Town Square and about 2 blocks from St.
en-unannotated-01021	Also, the sangria is delicious and the people are really nice.
en-unannotated-01022	It's very popular but the staff are very efficient and make sure you are not kept waiting.
en-unannotated-01023	Had to use suitcase to store clothes in a 5 Star Hotel.
en-unannotated-01024	Menu includes fresh and home made toast and...
en-unannotated-01025	- Staff acknowledge our room was bad, and offered a replacement... for an extra €2K/night, so we had to battle for a cancellation with the front desk (which the manager finally agreed to);
en-unannotated-01026	I never would have downloaded it if  not for the ton of coins as I don't care for these type games.
en-unannotated-01027	I chose it because of the many positive Ratings and I wasn't dissapointed.
en-unannotated-01028	A great spot for a great meal that will leave both you and your wallet full.
en-unannotated-01029	Location is within walking distance to the old town.
en-unannotated-01030	It was tasty but NOT spicy.
en-unannotated-01031	The place is gorgeous as all the other reviews have mentioned.
en-unannotated-01032	Good place to sleep.
en-unannotated-01033	We loved the location of this fine hotel about two blocks from The Zocalo.
en-unannotated-01034	The late check-in (18:00 hrs) makes it very convenient and practical.
en-unannotated-01035	I would recommend this hotel if you are staying in Bogota.
en-unannotated-01036	Our Parasian friends were very impressed and everyone had a great time!
en-unannotated-01037	Without a doubt this place has some of the best pizza in Paris.
en-unannotated-01038	True genuine bistrot feeling with some crazy innovative twists.
en-unannotated-01039	We wish we could of eaten more and tried more dishes that's how delicious our meal was.
en-unannotated-01040	I normally stay at the hotel next door but their lift was out so i chose this one.
en-unannotated-01041	For starters we had the grilled Prawn, then main course we had the Baked Crab...
en-unannotated-01042	We only had a night here, then moved down the street to Hotel Londres.
en-unannotated-01043	Nicer toppings than some places, like pumpkin.
en-unannotated-01044	However, the best part of the meal was the steak tartare.
en-unannotated-01045	We had to leave early because my father-in-law was not feeling well.
en-unannotated-01046	It is one of the unforgettable experiences during my stay in Barcelona.
en-unannotated-01047	Decided on the marinated pork ribs and all you can make potatoes with smoked salmon and cream.
en-unannotated-01048	There were multiple varieties of Risotto (most priced for 2). I found mine to be a little thick, but properly cooked.
en-unannotated-01049	It was my first time visiting South America, let alone Bogota.
en-unannotated-01050	They gave us a bowl of lemon water to wash our hands so I guess it means that we can just eat it with our hands
en-unannotated-01051	Thank you for a memorable wedding anniversary.
en-unannotated-01052	Yes, it's tiny and crammed, but the service was friendly and the soup delicious.
en-unannotated-01053	Dessert was stunning and both looked and tasted like a dish from a much higher priced restaurant.
en-unannotated-01054	Soup was good and the pancakes were really good.
en-unannotated-01055	We were given a smartphone on checkin - programmed with lots of useful information (tickets, shopping, travel, weather, emergency numbers, maps etc), plus free calls & texts - we thought this was a great idea and used it a lot to find our way around.
en-unannotated-01056	I walked towards the back and was greeted by a woman who looked she was both a hostess and server.
en-unannotated-01057	I opted for the price fix menu for 36 euros.
en-unannotated-01058	Then again, Czech might not be known for service.
en-unannotated-01059	While most of the restaurants in the main plaza were packed to the gills, Mlejnice was slightly out of the way and a table was instantly available.
en-unannotated-01060	Very friendly and professional Concierge especially [name]
en-unannotated-01061	For the main course, I had (again) the special, a sea bass that was cooked perfectly.
en-unannotated-01062	Interesting restaurant.
en-unannotated-01063	First things first!
en-unannotated-01064	We loved our stay
en-unannotated-01065	Purty noice I have a blood splatter keyboard rn an I like it just i guess I have to get used to typing on it because I dont type as fast anymore with it  an I misspell things easily  its just kind of harder to use
en-unannotated-01066	Day trip: John Mills is a bit unassuming.
en-unannotated-01067	So be prepared to walk a good distance to the elevators.
en-unannotated-01068	Don´t let the long...
en-unannotated-01069	I had the bugs, but they were pretty oily and for $60... I was expecting more quality.
en-unannotated-01070	From other mobiles which are connected to same hotspot are able to cast.
en-unannotated-01071	I liked this place so much that I broke my usual holiday rule and came here twice.
en-unannotated-01072	Bathroom in the room was spotless.
en-unannotated-01073	- The bed is quite uncomfortable.
en-unannotated-01074	We tried four different ones and a a couple of beers for...
en-unannotated-01075	The service was great and all our drink needs were certainly catered for and they were constantly topping up our Edamame plates.
en-unannotated-01076	Most of the things they say about this place is true.
en-unannotated-01077	Realize that everything tastes better in France because of the butter, but it sure was worth it!
en-unannotated-01078	Delicious meal with Awesome service.
en-unannotated-01079	Don't worry about brining your finest French, an English menu is also available, however your French linguistic efforts are appreciated!
en-unannotated-01080	Great for a casual meal.
en-unannotated-01081	I will definitely be back to P.Macs whenever I am in Dublin.
en-unannotated-01082	We didn't and had a 45 minute wait at 8 pm on a Sunday night.
en-unannotated-01083	The young lady that attended us spoke English and we were able to order.
en-unannotated-01084	The beers on offer may be underrated.
en-unannotated-01085	Ideal location
en-unannotated-01086	Great restaurant - Great food!
en-unannotated-01087	If you live here its definitely worth frequenting.
en-unannotated-01088	As it happens this restaurant is only a few metres away and as it looked inviting we enquired about a table.
en-unannotated-01089	This wouldve been a great app if it didn't block my account and tell me why.
en-unannotated-01090	We travelled for 5 weeks and this was...
en-unannotated-01091	There was also a nice bar area that on warmer evening would be glorious to sit and watch the world and river by.
en-unannotated-01092	The menu is not large, but everything is tasty.
en-unannotated-01093	My colleague suggested this restaurant stating it had very good fish tacos.
en-unannotated-01094	Affordable, really good food and excellent alcohol selection!
en-unannotated-01095	Just a block off the beach, the hotel is a convenient walk to the old city and its pintxos bars and less than 30 minutes the other direction to take the funicular up to Mt. Igueldo.
en-unannotated-01096	Definitely recommend for a true Parisian experience.
en-unannotated-01097	Ezeiza is a small hotel across the road from the beach.
en-unannotated-01098	Elegant, flavourful mouthfuls!
en-unannotated-01099	I think is honest and totally great!
en-unannotated-01100	Myself and my friend were delightfully full leaving with more coins in our pocket- diffenteily got value for money.
en-unannotated-01101	I also loved the cake and ice cream dessert I ordered at the end was incredible.
en-unannotated-01102	This is an amazing place that you won't find without asking the locals where the best place for local food and beer.
en-unannotated-01103	Teodora is an example of excellent hotel staff we wish her all the best
en-unannotated-01104	Not that it's not a criticism of the main course, but rather a complement to the accompanying food.
en-unannotated-01105	I had a window in the ceiling in my room, and through it I could see a fresco on the next level of ceiling - really impressive!
en-unannotated-01106	All you can watch is the news, Emmerdale and TV3s own shows.
en-unannotated-01107	This will be a definite repeat on my Paris visits.
en-unannotated-01108	The turbot with mushrooms was recommended and it did not disappoint.
en-unannotated-01109	The sandwiches.
en-unannotated-01110	On another occasion, my partner found the grilled fish only 'above average' which isn't a bad thing; only for their premium prices we expected perfection.
en-unannotated-01111	Each choice was delicious.
en-unannotated-01112	Also had the eggs Benedict boxty--which was nice and delicious as expected.
en-unannotated-01113	Booked the suite in this hotel.
en-unannotated-01114	The breakfast was a bit varied, good, but not always what we ordered.
en-unannotated-01115	Now it executes only when I read or delete messages through my pc.
en-unannotated-01116	Fast, no expensive and delicious.
en-unannotated-01117	Best place to go out for dinner in Mexico City, the food was delicious and they have awesome service
en-unannotated-01118	Cow central.
en-unannotated-01119	I did not know what to expect.
en-unannotated-01120	The property was clean and the suite was very spacious for 4 people.
en-unannotated-01121	Seriously?!?!?!
en-unannotated-01122	The location is in the shopping area.
en-unannotated-01123	Perfect place to land after a big night out in Madrid.
en-unannotated-01124	We had shared plates from the feasting menu and all the food was excellent!
en-unannotated-01125	It was packed but after jostling through the crowds, we found a small space to stand and enjoyed the Story Bridge and river views.
en-unannotated-01126	My main entree was white fish (the fresh dill was amazing) with rice and onions.
en-unannotated-01127	when i start play on 2M Shanghai table.
en-unannotated-01128	Service very good from hotel staff.
en-unannotated-01129	Tried this place based on a friend's recommendation while home in Dublin for the holidays and it became one of the highlights.
en-unannotated-01130	The place is at the heart of the old town.
en-unannotated-01131	I've never had a risotto taste the same way!
en-unannotated-01132	That seafood dish we had though, that was out this world, fresh and exquisite.
en-unannotated-01133	Oscar and the plentiful staff were 5+ stars.
en-unannotated-01134	Ended up being a part of the best night in Dublin.
en-unannotated-01135	4.5
en-unannotated-01136	Service was spot on with attentive and polite waitstaff.
en-unannotated-01137	Our breakfast was less than $20 for 2 orders of pancakes, eggs, water and two lattes.
en-unannotated-01138	We called and requested one and it never showed up.
en-unannotated-01139	The fish pie was excellent and the salmon was almost perfect.
en-unannotated-01140	I tried the Beef Tartare and the Potato Dumplings.
en-unannotated-01141	The octopus was tender and have the taste of the sea...
en-unannotated-01142	A must for anyone walking the Queen st Mall area.
en-unannotated-01143	Strong red/orange color tones.
en-unannotated-01144	Two great baristas serving locally roasted coffee as well as superb Nomad beans, home baked cakes too.
en-unannotated-01145	All for less than €10, too!
en-unannotated-01146	As soon as you walk through the door you notice this hotel has a great atmosphere.
en-unannotated-01147	When we walked in, dressed not so stylishly as been out taking in the sites so trainers and comfy clothes, we were greeted by a very smiley lady, we just wanted drinks and nothing to eat, which is no problem.
en-unannotated-01148	Brew is tucked away down an alleyway, relatively hard to find if you're not aware of its location however, this doesn't stop it from being extremely popular.
en-unannotated-01149	Excellent choice for dining in Milan!
en-unannotated-01150	Bedrooms are spacious and bathrooms compact.
en-unannotated-01151	With thanks to [NAME] the events coordinator and [NAME] the supreme chef.
en-unannotated-01152	I'm happy with their price, staff and rooms.
en-unannotated-01153	The place is small and there was a line forming outside after we sat down.
en-unannotated-01154	Hot chips, watermelon and goat cheese and asparagus were all delicious.
en-unannotated-01155	Great location - walkable to so many sights.
en-unannotated-01156	Nothing.
en-unannotated-01157	Got to witness her preparing the appetizers as well as the main courses.
en-unannotated-01158	One of the worst apps ever.
en-unannotated-01159	After getting our drinks we were taken into the restaurant by the hostess and seated at a table in the middle.
en-unannotated-01160	restaurant is clean and service great...
en-unannotated-01161	The bathroom is nice and big.
en-unannotated-01162	It is just like sitting in their kitchen!
en-unannotated-01163	They were so nice for upgrading us to a two bedroom suite located on the ground floor.
en-unannotated-01164	Excellent toiletries and towels in bathroom but be careful on the dark stairs and avoid walking into the numerous glass doors.
en-unannotated-01165	Pancakes and pouched eggs were really delicious.
en-unannotated-01166	First night we found poo in the shower however was cleaned up instantly by housekeeping as soon as it was reported.
en-unannotated-01167	All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.
en-unannotated-01168	great service and very reasonable prices.

en-unannotated-01173	Next time in Paris will book again
en-unannotated-01174	the perfect breakfast, nice rooms, service excellent, we will come back soon
en-unannotated-01175	Internet was not working properly
en-unannotated-01176	They aren't bad, though.
en-unannotated-01177	The breakfast was excellent!
en-unannotated-01178	We will be back.
en-unannotated-01179	We had a boat tour waiting for us and we were looking for a place to eat quick lunch.
en-unannotated-01180	We had seen [name]'s recommendation to go here while in Paris and boy are we glad we went!
en-unannotated-01181	The hotel is a former 19th century palace near the Royal Palace and the Opera.
en-unannotated-01182	The Sheraton in Bogotà is one of the best I ever stayed, the service was very kind and professional, the security high even if not making the guests feel uncomfortable, the SPA and pool nice, only the gym was a bit small.
en-unannotated-01183	My family and I arrived off a red eye from NY Tuesday morning.
en-unannotated-01184	Excellent location, amazing rooms, superior staff, beautiful pool - impressive!
en-unannotated-01185	Some of our party had dessert or cheese boards and they were all top class.
en-unannotated-01186	Great
en-unannotated-01187	Suffice it to say, our first dinner in Prague left us wondering what else was in store.
en-unannotated-01188	Thanks for the great service.
en-unannotated-01189	Breakfast had a nice spread of fresh fruits etc.
en-unannotated-01190	but the waitress said if there was a spot at the bar we could eat.
en-unannotated-01191	thanks....
en-unannotated-01192	Busy place- so be patient-the staff is very pleasant happy and accommodating.
en-unannotated-01193	At P macs!
en-unannotated-01194	We were...
en-unannotated-01195	Their coffee was very good and their bakery was so delicious.
en-unannotated-01196	The atmosphere was cozy & interesting; 9 people from all over the world.
en-unannotated-01197	Whaaat?
en-unannotated-01198	Beautiful restaurant, friendly service and delicious food.
en-unannotated-01199	We came to this place first 6 years ago and when we came back to Paris we knew we had to return.
en-unannotated-01200	I wasn't too thrilled with the side salad, but I wasn't here for greens.
en-unannotated-01201	Choosing to stay at the FS Casa Medina was probably my best hotel choice last year.
en-unannotated-01202	location very good
en-unannotated-01203	For our meal we ordered two savory pancakes, bacon, cheddar with green onion and the ricotta, pesto, ham with a fried egg on top (additional), and a sweet one to finish, the lemon cream!
en-unannotated-01204	Ohh make your reservations we were lucky and had to promise to be out in an hour and a half, that by Italian standards is fast!!
en-unannotated-01205	The goulash and the short rib were really great and the potato salad wow!
en-unannotated-01206	We couldn't stop raving about it.
en-unannotated-01207	They had just opened, and I was the second diner to arrive.
en-unannotated-01208	Highly recommended.
en-unannotated-01209	I have tried different pizza places in Bogota and so far this is the best.
en-unannotated-01210	And they serve them fast.
en-unannotated-01211	The bartender said it was not just the oldest, but the best pub in Ireland with such conviction, he might have persuaded me.
en-unannotated-01212	If this happens, you would have to make sure that when people go out of the app but don't clear their history and go back into the app that the game resets also...
en-unannotated-01213	Il Becco Italian restaurant in the hotel was excellent - delicious food.
en-unannotated-01214	Absolutely disgraceful app..
en-unannotated-01215	I had a wonderful pasta.
en-unannotated-01216	I don't recommend this hotel for families .
en-unannotated-01217	Could use one or two more staff during rush hour but everyone is friendly and the Guinness and beef stew was tasty enough to make you almost forgot someone brought their plague child to the next table.
en-unannotated-01218	The food was so tasty and again great value for money!
en-unannotated-01219	and also fix this my power,aim, time and spin on legendary cue.
en-unannotated-01220	and walks along the promenade and swim in the sea, comfortable and spacious rooms and bathrooms ,quite rooms, friendly staff, clean rooms and very pleasing stay!
en-unannotated-01221	Service was awesome.
en-unannotated-01222	Hands down one of the best meals I've had while in Ireland.
en-unannotated-01223	The staff at this hotel were some of the most professional, friendly and helpful I have met, the most convivial hosts who could not do enough to help.
en-unannotated-01224	What a wonderful place to stay at in the heart of Rome so close to everything !
en-unannotated-01225	How am I supposed to know how good of an app it is and rate it 5 stars if I'm not even able to use it yet?
en-unannotated-01226	My partner and I recently discovered Verve a few months ago, and have since gone there for lunch every few weeks or so.
en-unannotated-01227	So for the record, it's pretty.
en-unannotated-01228	Rooms spacious with walk in wet room showers.
en-unannotated-01229	Only one other table was taken in the front room.
en-unannotated-01230	Amazing bright modern super cool rooms, great service, huge jacuzzi and fantastic staff.
en-unannotated-01231	This place is very strictly orientated - you will get there nothing else but mussels only.
en-unannotated-01232	We ended up being in the raw meats line, and then had to go to the back of the other line.
en-unannotated-01233	I had a delightful fish dish and my husband ordered a pork chop.
en-unannotated-01234	My husband and I visited La Casa de Tono on our first night in MC last week, and it was wonderful!
en-unannotated-01235	Its been renamed
en-unannotated-01236	Seems like it's not many locals come here.
en-unannotated-01237	I'm all over the board with Peklo.
en-unannotated-01238	You come inside and you sit down and this place still looks like meh.
en-unannotated-01239	As good as I've had (and I've had a few!!)
en-unannotated-01240	BREW is like that classmate in a group assignment who isn't necessarily the smartest, but they always turn up on time and don't suck to be around.
en-unannotated-01241	I like the fact that they have good security.
en-unannotated-01242	Through conversations, ppl also recommend the French onion soup because someone came back twice for their soup！
en-unannotated-01243	Dont skip this place.
en-unannotated-01244	Efficient service with the use of the buttons at each table.
en-unannotated-01245	For the main course we ordered the gratin and the duck breast.
en-unannotated-01246	Would definitley recommend.
en-unannotated-01247	Its telling a lie when it says FREE music.
en-unannotated-01248	Comfy place and very good food.
en-unannotated-01249	I wish I can have some right now.
en-unannotated-01250	I felt that they were the perfect portion size.
en-unannotated-01251	Their sandwiches are amazing and they play good music :) Love it !
en-unannotated-01252	It was fun while it lasted.
en-unannotated-01253	It was quickly prepared but very well done.
en-unannotated-01254	That is ok though since the toppings and sauces were delicious.
en-unannotated-01255	Could not find a single ride for me.
en-unannotated-01256	When a tourist inexperienced in the local cuisine gives a Trip advisor high rating you have to think what would they really know to compare it too.
en-unannotated-01257	We ordered a gnocchi dish and the bread bowl goulash and both were very oily.
en-unannotated-01258	service really good....
en-unannotated-01259	Combined with roasted garlic, mushrooms, spinach, mint and just the right about of chilli, this was a very flavoursome dish, and at a reasonable price.
en-unannotated-01260	All in all, cute quaint restaurant that also sells specialty items in the side.
en-unannotated-01261	We wish we had saved room for dessert because I know it would have been amazing.
en-unannotated-01262	What can I say but this restaurant was Absolutely outstanding food, great ambience and superb service by our waiter!
en-unannotated-01263	It's a fine burger, but an annoying experience and pricy for what you get.
en-unannotated-01264	My user profile was supposed to migrate over - payment details, home address, trip history, ratings etc - but nothing has.
en-unannotated-01265	romantic, modern and accommodative!!
en-unannotated-01266	We ordered the tasting menu with the matching wines.
en-unannotated-01267	We each had a pasta dish, and then split a pizza.
en-unannotated-01268	The huge tap selection is a crowd pleaser, and a decent wine list along with a pleasing food offering keeps everyone content.
en-unannotated-01269	The guys use fresh organic milk and seasonal coffees.
en-unannotated-01270	Very nice restaurant with central location.
en-unannotated-01271	They come out as a stack of three with a generous amount of toppings between each layer and a final topping crowning the topmost pancake.
en-unannotated-01272	The host was so accommodating and really tried to help everyone that came in.
en-unannotated-01273	A starter and main course for under 20 euro.
en-unannotated-01274	Not far from actual Port.
en-unannotated-01275	Before you know it, the cones are all done & you're left with a bowl of dreams.
en-unannotated-01276	The breakfast was excellent.
en-unannotated-01277	Coffeemania offers sit down food service (for those expecting Starbucks style counter service). Broad menu for food, coffee drinks and sweets.
en-unannotated-01278	I got the corn beef meal and a cider for a late lunch, which both were amazing.
en-unannotated-01279	If the staff are the human face of any hotel, and they are, then this hotel has the friendliest and most welcoming face in Spain.
en-unannotated-01280	It was a beautiful presentation and an exceptional dish.
en-unannotated-01281	If somebody told me caffee latte can taste so good I wouldn't believe.
en-unannotated-01282	The ravioli lived up to my expectations.
en-unannotated-01283	It was getting late and not many restaurants were open.
en-unannotated-01284	Just perfect.
en-unannotated-01285	Many options to choose from.
en-unannotated-01286	[NAME], the hostess was very friendly and seated us quickly.
en-unannotated-01287	The bedroom corridors all had different kind of décor so it looked untidy, and housekeeping carts were left lying around.
en-unannotated-01288	The ambiance was fantastic, the staff was friendly and most importantly the food was amazing!!!
en-unannotated-01289	Developer i will.
en-unannotated-01290	I never felt pressured to leave, though I imagine it's very different at peak hours.
en-unannotated-01291	Another good bet are the small Spanish fried green peppers sprinkled with ample portion of sea salt.
en-unannotated-01292	Style of hotel was chic and glamorous though a little tired.
en-unannotated-01293	I booked this hotel because of the suite and feel that maybe better record keeping could avoid problems.
en-unannotated-01294	If this is likely to be an issue for you ask to be on the first floor or above.
en-unannotated-01295	We stayed only for 1 night, we choose it as it was barely 500m way from Arzak and very close to the center of the city.
en-unannotated-01296	great service, friendly and a must visit if you love a good coffee
en-unannotated-01297	And our favorite cake.
en-unannotated-01298	Room was clean and staff was very friendly.
en-unannotated-01299	I came here for dinner once and lunch recently, and I find they have some interesting stuff on their menu.
en-unannotated-01300	So perhaps my review is a bit skewed, but what the heck?
en-unannotated-01301	We spent about 20 euros for the...
en-unannotated-01302	The couple running the place were delightful.
en-unannotated-01303	Cmon you didn't expect a 100% perfect experience did you?
en-unannotated-01304	We were recommended by a friend who had been the night before.
en-unannotated-01305	Anywhere.
en-unannotated-01306	Started with the Banks Overdraft and it was soooooo good.
en-unannotated-01307	Our steaks were perfectly cooked, juicy and delicious.
en-unannotated-01308	The escargot was delicious!
en-unannotated-01309	I finally settled on bruschetta topped with buffalo mozzarella, anchovy, basil and olive oil.
en-unannotated-01310	Simple place with one of the best coffee I ever tried.
en-unannotated-01311	Yum, Yum, Yum!
en-unannotated-01312	Space is limited but that's the charm of this place.
en-unannotated-01313	Atmosphere: friendly, soft - great
en-unannotated-01314	I did get to try their Kinder Bueno spring roll dessert.
en-unannotated-01315	The service was friendly and prompt.
en-unannotated-01316	What a treat!
en-unannotated-01317	And it is YUMMY!
en-unannotated-01318	Trust me.
en-unannotated-01319	It is a quite economic hotel, basic but clean.
en-unannotated-01320	I have uninstalled it and then install it again almost everyday but it keeps running like that.
en-unannotated-01321	Front desk staff also very pleasant.
en-unannotated-01322	The meat on offer at this restaurant is excellent.
en-unannotated-01323	Amazing Pizza and desserts.
en-unannotated-01324	We arrived shortly before the 9pm reservation time.
en-unannotated-01325	but the problem is sometimes my stick time is so less.
en-unannotated-01326	Please keep the features coming and the app improvements!
en-unannotated-01327	Only say 15 on the main dining room.
en-unannotated-01328	Kind staff, but over the past two years, the food quality has gone down pretty badly.
en-unannotated-01329	In Bogota the best deal for any occasion.
en-unannotated-01330	We just ate a few of the many varieties of mussel dishes, tossing the shells on the floor as is the custom.
en-unannotated-01331	A charming terrace with the sound from the river made it a pleasant...
en-unannotated-01332	We had read that this was the best deal in Czech food in Prague.
en-unannotated-01333	-N/A
en-unannotated-01334	For a coeliac finding cupcakes is often hard.
en-unannotated-01335	It's a mistake to skip this restaurant but it's easy to do.
en-unannotated-01336	Football on and full of locals.
en-unannotated-01337	good coffee and orange juice.
en-unannotated-01338	[4/5] There was a pungent goat cheese that I really enjoyed on this one.
en-unannotated-01339	I will recommend for sure
en-unannotated-01340	I love their apple cobbler dessert and crepes.
en-unannotated-01341	I do.
en-unannotated-01342	I had an interesting "couscous" salad made of broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, carrot, tomato, and red onion (and probably a few other veggies thrown in). Everything was grated/diced to incredibly small rice-like texture.
en-unannotated-01343	Very cosy & nicely decorated and very clean rooms.
en-unannotated-01344	We went here after seeing all the rave yelp reviews on our final night of our 2 days trip in Prague.
en-unannotated-01345	Staff need to move away from an intimidatory approach that all customers are going to do something wrong.
en-unannotated-01346	Its fun but it is way too easy, after playing about 40 levels i only found like 2 or 3 challenging ones.
en-unannotated-01347	Everybody else says its hard.
en-unannotated-01348	The cakes were delicious although quite expensive.
en-unannotated-01349	The food was great too.
en-unannotated-01350	As for the food: I ordered the avocado toast which came topped with ricotta cheese.
en-unannotated-01351	Your current 9-ball game mode sucks!
en-unannotated-01352	thanks.
en-unannotated-01353	You can enjoy dinner whilst watching the world go by.
en-unannotated-01354	It was a cold day with the temperatures hovering around freezing and we didn't want to sit outside (though there were small heat lamps), so we walked across the cobblestone car park, up the stairs, and then down the stairs and into the cave restaurant that is Pelko.
en-unannotated-01355	However, when I open my matches tab it is always empty.
en-unannotated-01356	), Rustic Old World prepared Potato-Mushroom soup, Cabbage salad, Roast Duck with potato dumplings.
en-unannotated-01357	This is my second time to visit this fantastic restaurant.
en-unannotated-01358	Chose this for a special dinner.
en-unannotated-01359	Maybe social customs vary in different parts of the world, but the manager's attitude is sososososo bad.
en-unannotated-01360	Bed heads shaking if one moved in bed + one of the metal ports of bed head broken which added to rattle.
en-unannotated-01361	I usually don't go to many restaurants twice, but I'd make an exception for this restaurant since I'm undeniably in love with it.
en-unannotated-01362	Honestly, the restaurant has a little bummed me out.
en-unannotated-01363	Had two meals here while vacationing in Mexico City.
en-unannotated-01364	Hotel is on a mountain next to San Sebastian (in Monte Igeldo) hence views of the city, sea and mountains are wonderful.
en-unannotated-01365	Sadly too far from the town.
en-unannotated-01366	Would definitely come back here for a nice...
en-unannotated-01367	We asked for a chicken and a beef burger, they were sadly out of beef and the *very* nice waitress was kind enough to offer us drinks and serve us two of the best chicken burgers I've ever tasted.
en-unannotated-01368	To finish things off, grilled pineapple served with mango gelato and lingenberrjes.
en-unannotated-01369	We came solely on Yelp reviews- and well worth it.
en-unannotated-01370	I wouldnt spend an hour of my hard earned money for such a simple game.
en-unannotated-01371	The atmosphere is fab, great music and just a lot of fun!
en-unannotated-01372	The driver took us on a round about path and dropped us off on a crowded sidewalk 150 yards from the entrance and charged us 15 euro more than the hotel driver would have.
en-unannotated-01373	Even though we were stuffed we had to try the dessert.
en-unannotated-01374	At first it will let you do that 3 or 4 times.
en-unannotated-01375	We went on our last night in Spain after 13 days traveling through Spain.
en-unannotated-01376	Exposed brickwork and large, slightly tinted windows into the kitchen complete the resulting intimate dining experience.
en-unannotated-01377	Probably the best restaurant in Mexico for genuine Mexican food!
en-unannotated-01378	I have had delicious duck breast elsewhere in Paris so I know what it can taste like.
en-unannotated-01379	I don't think so!
en-unannotated-01380	We were deferring to the time and place since our only other experience with Goulash was back in the states.
en-unannotated-01381	I had high hopes for the oldest pub in Ireland, and it did not disappoint.
en-unannotated-01382	This was the best Czech meal I've eaten in Prague.
en-unannotated-01383	The duck appetizer was delicious and our favorite meal was the potato gratin.
en-unannotated-01384	Great little place with a fantastic Gratin, good wine and nice music.
en-unannotated-01385	This coupled with the fact that she is a traditionally trained French chef lends this fusion of quite different worlds, to a marriage made in heaven.
en-unannotated-01386	Enjoy for yourself.
en-unannotated-01387	We had the pulpo as appetizer and ceviche and salad as main course.
en-unannotated-01388	Large bed.
en-unannotated-01389	We all enjoyed our food and the atmosphere was cozy and romantic (the couples on either side of us were holding hands as they ate haha).
en-unannotated-01390	We ordered a burger with fries and the seafood chowder.
en-unannotated-01391	Our stay was perfect.
en-unannotated-01392	Hidden gem of Praha and a chill place to kick back with friends.
en-unannotated-01393	:P
en-unannotated-01394	Medium or medium rare come with pepper and corns.
en-unannotated-01395	I ordered the bistro gratin which had tomatoes and bacon in addition to the potatoes and cheese.
en-unannotated-01396	This hotel is rated 4 and not 5 star and you can most certainly tell the difference.
en-unannotated-01397	We found it in Mexico City at the Marquis Reforma.
en-unannotated-01398	The owner made us feel comfortable and we had a very very fine meal.
en-unannotated-01399	Prices overall were very reasonable, with each dish at about $8-10, and everything was very filling (duh).
en-unannotated-01400	Doesn't work on either android or the Samsung TVs its beyond a joke
en-unannotated-01401	But sometimes when I get new emails I have to close app and reopen for it to update.
en-unannotated-01402	Great location close to restaurants and the 93 park.
en-unannotated-01403	This is the second time that this has happened and it cost me majority of my coins!
en-unannotated-01404	The food at the restaurant is outstanding.
en-unannotated-01405	The service is really good, and they have a little button you can click to call the waiter which I found pretty handy!
en-unannotated-01406	Tuna was fresh.
en-unannotated-01407	There is a selection of the staple sushi and sashimi, tataki, teriyaki, tempura and yakitori along with some creative touches like tuna belly, tonkatsu cups, stuffed quail and popcorn shrimp - an absolute must as an appetiser.
en-unannotated-01408	Piazza Venezia was 5 minutes walk from the hotel.
en-unannotated-01409	4) Around 2kms(approx) from station
en-unannotated-01410	So please don't stop at the front.
en-unannotated-01411	Excellent!
en-unannotated-01412	The room was very comfortable and big.
en-unannotated-01413	Very clean.
en-unannotated-01414	I urge you to check out this gem of the Brisbane dining scene and make sure you go hungry - their serving sizes are generous and your meal will be so tasty that you're going to want to be able to finish it!
en-unannotated-01415	I did not have a reservation and arrived at 9:45pm.
en-unannotated-01416	The manager was also rather rude to me while I was waiting to pay.
en-unannotated-01417	Must order the tacos!
en-unannotated-01418	Location is great.
en-unannotated-01419	I'm not sure if it's because I'm a Melbourne girl or that my body is around 80% coffee by now, but seeking them out in every city is a favourite pass time of time.
en-unannotated-01420	She told us the wait is an hour and to wait at the bar.
en-unannotated-01421	A warm bread basket.
en-unannotated-01422	me and a lot of friends not taking snaps or putting in the story because of that..
en-unannotated-01423	It's served in patty form.
en-unannotated-01424	It makes a great date night in Paris but make sure you call for reservations at least a day ahead or more.
en-unannotated-01425	Having said that, this place is still worth it.
en-unannotated-01426	I have been in Bogota for a few days and, at the end, I decided to go here.
en-unannotated-01427	The spam is getting overwhelming more fake profiles than real ones I'll get 2 or 3 real ones after going tho 20 fakes it's getting ridiculous
en-unannotated-01428	I was frightened to death.
en-unannotated-01429	Great food, good service.
en-unannotated-01430	Apart from the good coffee he also...
en-unannotated-01431	Saké is perfect for special occasions, in this case it was a birthday dinner for two.
en-unannotated-01432	I can't speak highly enough of the staff.
en-unannotated-01433	This was one of my favorite meals during my week in Russia.
en-unannotated-01434	The outsides of the cakes had started to...
en-unannotated-01435	Not enough light in the bathroom.
en-unannotated-01436	We checked in online and our selected room was ready.
en-unannotated-01437	It's consistent with the best level of service and food.
en-unannotated-01438	The room I stayed was noisy and als does not have a split aircon so if you swicth the air con you will have more noise to handle.
en-unannotated-01439	with a fixed "surprise" menu.
en-unannotated-01440	Food and service were superb!
en-unannotated-01441	We started with the mushrooms stuffed with spicy cheese.
en-unannotated-01442	Breakfast was good and the room has a kettle etc but you need to bring your own tea and coffee.
en-unannotated-01443	I was surprised that there weren't any 2 seater tables, almost all were at least 4, which meant a lot of couples had to share with strangers as the place got more crowded.
en-unannotated-01444	Were working fine yesterday and then last night they just stopped
en-unannotated-01445	Friendly attentive customer service.
en-unannotated-01446	The also have games.
en-unannotated-01447	Good value.
en-unannotated-01448	Cons:
en-unannotated-01449	So many interesting sounding dishes.
en-unannotated-01450	Quantity was fine though.
en-unannotated-01451	The sheer size of the burger was amazing.
en-unannotated-01452	Also, the foreign extra stout is delish!
en-unannotated-01453	The gambas ala plancha are cooked when you order them as are the peppers.
en-unannotated-01454	He didn't look up and didn't even offer to share a bite of the lamb!
en-unannotated-01455	Once we were finished they quickly cleaned up and made the table and were ready to get a new customer seated.
en-unannotated-01456	Crashed 4 times during the start up ads but I persisted only for it to crash during the first ad break after watching 15 mins of the show.
en-unannotated-01457	However inside lies chunks of bread with 3 types of soft and melted cheese.
en-unannotated-01458	The pancakes were absolutely delicious and so fresh.
en-unannotated-01459	Honestly I believe the concept is great - you have a dinner at Chef's home with the people you haven't met before.
en-unannotated-01460	I chose to go with the 2 course option: crab cakes to start and the cottage pie.
en-unannotated-01461	My friends and I found this restaurant via Yelp.
en-unannotated-01462	beach is not for swimming, wavy and the water is quite cold.
en-unannotated-01463	We found this great restaurant a few blocks from our hotel and had an amazing dinner.
en-unannotated-01464	Isabel and Pilar, the two sisters who run the restaurant, made us feel as visiting a Spanish home where they cook the...
en-unannotated-01465	A seriously substantial meal and I couldn't even finish my chips.
en-unannotated-01466	Easy to take the bus into San Sebastian.
en-unannotated-01467	The room was lovely, breakfast was super (not cheap however), lovely cocktail bar.
en-unannotated-01468	The Hyatt, IC and Marriott are all beside each other and I have stayed in all three: the Hyatt is easily the best of them.
en-unannotated-01469	But the rest I love about it!
en-unannotated-01470	The room was lovely and clean and had all necessities.
en-unannotated-01471	I had the duck over potatoes with salad and my wife had the steak and vegetables and we were both very happy.
en-unannotated-01472	Everything was good, the appartment and the location
en-unannotated-01473	A guest got up and sand the bday song to my husband in French, that was.
en-unannotated-01474	A frivolous treat.
en-unannotated-01475	I don't know what else I can add that has not already been said about this restaurant other than to just reiterate that this is one of the best restaurants in Paris.
en-unannotated-01476	This is another great place to have Asian food, mostly Pho and some delicious cold appetizer salads.
en-unannotated-01477	how can a big compang like this ignore this kind of stuff..
en-unannotated-01478	Not so far from Seine river.
en-unannotated-01479	Awesome Churros and chocolate friendly service great little business..

en-unannotated-01482	The staff was very friendly and accommodating.
en-unannotated-01483	I am on a mission everyday to find the best games out there.
en-unannotated-01484	Service: top
en-unannotated-01485	The service is a little confusing as "to go" prices are different than "sit down" prices.
en-unannotated-01486	Previous Yelp advisors suggested some of the same you'll read here.
en-unannotated-01487	ND speciaLy Love the new Update buT i Give u Ine new sugesstion to add higher games play with friendss...

en-unannotated-01490	It has a nice mix of locals, business people, and tourists.
en-unannotated-01491	The ambiance is nice and inviting.
en-unannotated-01492	We stayed 3 nights at this beautiful place in our short visit to Bogotá and we highly recommend it.
en-unannotated-01493	Five stars for food,service,hospitality ,great menu a very hard working family restaurant.
en-unannotated-01494	Spend the night with my wife.
en-unannotated-01495	Its a very charming hotel.
en-unannotated-01496	There are only two tables in that area but you get to watch the chef up close prepare the entire meal.
en-unannotated-01497	Very good Queen size bed, pillow menu and very good variety and quality of the amenities.
en-unannotated-01498	Good enough for me to return to it, in any case - twice.
en-unannotated-01499	I found their Pho Bo really tasty and met my expectation.
en-unannotated-01500	Service was just OK and the food was also just OK.
en-unannotated-01501	Only after you die do they pop up.
en-unannotated-01502	We stayed at the Hotel Villa Magna for 5 days after finding it on TripAdvisor when we weren't thrilled with the hotels recommended by our travel agent.
en-unannotated-01503	I strongly recommend the "beef in cream sauce", one of the best beefs i had and the sauce is really good, the sweet type.
en-unannotated-01504	This place is amazing!!!!!
en-unannotated-01505	Great way to end off the night.
en-unannotated-01506	The negatives relate to noise and discomfort.
en-unannotated-01507	Awesome overall experience...
en-unannotated-01508	Thank you.
en-unannotated-01509	First of all, we had a long tiring flight and when we reached the hotel it was around 11 and they refused to give us our rooms they said we have to wait until 3 and there is no way they can give the rooms before even if our energy level is zero..
en-unannotated-01510	There is something for everyone including vegetarians, and the value is excellent!
en-unannotated-01511	The mule was fresh, reasonable price (especially in compare with other restaurant in Bonifacio) with plenty of sauce options.
en-unannotated-01512	The veggies themselves were raw but the plate was served warm.
en-unannotated-01513	A big mirror.
en-unannotated-01514	Great value.
en-unannotated-01515	The front door lock needs fixing, almost locked out.
en-unannotated-01516	With that being said, I expected to be there for a long time and was pleasantly surprised that was not the case.
en-unannotated-01517	A total of about 8 tables in the "kitchenbardiningeating" area.
en-unannotated-01518	When paid for rare+ other boxes it would take money but not give the box.
en-unannotated-01519	It's a potato pancake that's very similar to a crepe.
en-unannotated-01520	the staff were really friendly and helpful.
en-unannotated-01521	But downloaded another in order to get more coins.
en-unannotated-01522	Awful sounds of rubbish cleaner from outside at 4-5 am that was alarming through the closed window.
en-unannotated-01523	This is a beautiful hotel in a very good location, right next to the Royal Palace, Royal Theater & Gran Via.
en-unannotated-01524	Staff was cool not overly friendly but not rude.
en-unannotated-01525	Lolly is a gracious, outgoing, generous woman!
en-unannotated-01526	I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for an authentic Italian pasta dish.
en-unannotated-01527	The one we had was served with super fresh cantaloupe and prosciutto shaved thinly enough so you could taste all its salty goodness it had to offer.
en-unannotated-01528	This is primarily a business hotel, so the rooms and amenities are catered mostly to business crowds.
en-unannotated-01529	In general, there wasn't anything that I didn't like.
en-unannotated-01530	The wine list is good and there is a bar in case you arrive early.
en-unannotated-01531	Booking
en-unannotated-01532	The personnel is super friendly and always willing to help.
en-unannotated-01533	Wonderful small bistro beside the Pantheon at Paris' top university.
en-unannotated-01534	Everything is presented well and the atmosphere is pleasant.
en-unannotated-01535	The pancakes are amazing, and so was the cappuccino.
en-unannotated-01536	We were very happy with the hotel's appearance, cleanliness and staff friendliness.
en-unannotated-01537	Off the beaten path and well worth finding.
en-unannotated-01538	My husband and I had such a fun, FUN night.
en-unannotated-01539	Most fine dining restaurants will offer a fixed course menu, but will never offer you the same experience for wine, here at the Boutary you get to try three different wines of superb quality for the price of a mid range bottle of Bordeaux, this...
en-unannotated-01540	Never worked on tablet, plays ads then black screen same in browser
en-unannotated-01541	They phoned us to ensure that we had no special allergies or food problems.
en-unannotated-01542	They go perfectly with a nice cafe Americano.
en-unannotated-01543	Yeah sure "it's closed why should it play". Even if I close all other apps doesn't mean I want my music to stop.
en-unannotated-01544	The burger filling is generous, which made it a challenge (ie messy) to eat, but it was delicious!
en-unannotated-01545	I have to say that Czech cuisine definitely takes some time to get used to.
en-unannotated-01546	We were wandering down !!!
en-unannotated-01547	Staff was very friendly and moved us to a better table once it opened up.
en-unannotated-01548	Amazing pancakes and coffee!!!
en-unannotated-01549	La Puerta Falsa was recommended to us by a Bogota local, which is always a good sign.
en-unannotated-01550	Room superb, clean, good air con and hot shower.
en-unannotated-01551	We also enjoyed soups, asparagus and potato, as starters.
en-unannotated-01552	Spam/Fake
en-unannotated-01553	The staff and owner are very skilled in dealing with English speakers notorious for poor command of the beautiful French language.
en-unannotated-01554	If we sent it back, we would have definitely received extra french ingredients.
en-unannotated-01555	It is cheap, delicious, and filling.
en-unannotated-01556	This was fantastic evening, delicious meal and peaceful athmosphere!
en-unannotated-01557	Highly recommend.
en-unannotated-01558	How to skip, browse or deny a find a quest quest?
en-unannotated-01559	The best part of the meal was the service.
en-unannotated-01560	Wonderful staff
en-unannotated-01561	The restaurant is tiny, but really cozy (if you dont like to sit close - and I mean really close!
en-unannotated-01562	delicious 3 bean soup, avocado and bean salad, jam compot.
en-unannotated-01563	They ordered steaks which came with chopped salads and mustards.
en-unannotated-01564	There are scores of anxious folks patiently waiting for their meats, ready to unleash their inner savage at any moment now.
en-unannotated-01565	No reservation but the waitor found us a table promptly.
en-unannotated-01566	Everything is fresh, simple and tasty.
en-unannotated-01567	Our server was great.
en-unannotated-01568	Very nice common areas on ground floor.
en-unannotated-01569	Room was very nice and clean.
en-unannotated-01570	Also room service we had to call thrice to make up the room
en-unannotated-01571	Le Temps des Cerises is a popular neighborhood place, and can seat perhaps 30, so definitely make a reservation.
en-unannotated-01572	The waitresss suggested that they get a side to go with it as the salad was quite simple but they declined, not being overly hungry.
en-unannotated-01573	We got the dry aged cote de boeuf for around 58 euros for 2 people.
en-unannotated-01574	, not much to say there.
en-unannotated-01575	Have fun!
en-unannotated-01576	Had the ribs for a starter, also mind-blowingly delicious!
en-unannotated-01577	BUT rest assured it's ONLY because the folks you've been ordering it from make it ALL wrong!
en-unannotated-01578	I was very impressed by the ambiance.
en-unannotated-01579	The only disadvantage is the old style windows that look on the street and are not soundproof - life starts at 6 am with garbage collection and then goes on with supplies coming, cleaning, etc.
en-unannotated-01580	The food was absolutely divine.
en-unannotated-01581	More Noma-style than mediteraranian.
en-unannotated-01582	I will definitely return on my next visit to Paris.
en-unannotated-01583	Love the girls and the sixties italian decor!!
en-unannotated-01584	The server was super friendly and attentive.
en-unannotated-01585	But if I had to choose, I would go for the duck breast.
en-unannotated-01586	My husband and I stumbled across this cute little cafe upon our travels in Madrid.
en-unannotated-01587	They also have your staple seafood like lobster rolls and oysters.
en-unannotated-01588	I wanted to know how they worked - thinking a bell would go off.
en-unannotated-01589	She ordered the mini pancakes topped with strawberries and I had the plum, gingerbread and sour cream pancakes.
en-unannotated-01590	A "hidden" part of Brisbane's dining scene, but well worth the find in one of Brisbane's thriving Laneways.
en-unannotated-01591	Short but an enjoyable stay.
en-unannotated-01592	Delicious lunch.
en-unannotated-01593	Panna cotta which was a great dessert!
en-unannotated-01594	Near everything , g zone and t zone.
en-unannotated-01595	Highly recommended if you're in the area!
en-unannotated-01596	Had a prawn risotto to start that was a really generous portion and absolutely delicious.
en-unannotated-01597	The location is great, just two blocks from the Zócalo of Mexico City.
en-unannotated-01598	The location was excellent.
en-unannotated-01599	I play this game alot, I payed the outrageous price of $10, and I'm almost done with it.
en-unannotated-01600	Balcony with furniture was dirty, was not rooftops as advertised.
en-unannotated-01601	The beer offerings were great.
en-unannotated-01602	From the moment we arrived we had the most wonderful time.
en-unannotated-01603	The staff truly elevates the experience at this hotel.
en-unannotated-01604	The staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, nothing was too much trouble and they gave us some fantastic recommendations for eating, walking and Madrid sites.
en-unannotated-01605	The room was clean with a modern finish with a very nice Ocean view.
en-unannotated-01606	The place is like an eatery museum, if there were such thing.
en-unannotated-01607	The staff are friendly and the price is...
en-unannotated-01608	Particularly recommended the popcorn prawns and the Sashimi tacos!
en-unannotated-01609	Our adorable waiter took us back to town in his own personal car.
en-unannotated-01610	Coffeemania presents one of the best...
en-unannotated-01611	We couldn't agree more.
en-unannotated-01612	Give them a try!
en-unannotated-01613	The prices were fair.
en-unannotated-01614	The location is within walking distance to restaurants and Parque 93. Plus it has a quiet location.
en-unannotated-01615	Great, but we were charged for the full amount.
en-unannotated-01616	Overall, a great meal in Paris!
en-unannotated-01617	Old Town Coffee is set in a supermarket, they have a bar with a few stalls, so we were able to take our time and enjoyed talking to the team that run the coffee shop.
en-unannotated-01618	The service was excellent the girl Cecilia explained everything very well and she is very attentive and friendly.
en-unannotated-01619	The stew was filling and was flavorful.
en-unannotated-01620	Amazing dish.
en-unannotated-01621	Also the cappuccino was excellent.
en-unannotated-01622	and cheap as well.
en-unannotated-01623	This has been the best Traditional Czech food restaurant I've been to in Prague.
en-unannotated-01624	Went with my bf and flatmate.
en-unannotated-01625	My wife was very impressed.
en-unannotated-01626	I look for less touristy, more authentic every time I eat.
en-unannotated-01627	There are 2 nightly weekend seatings and as we had tickets for later in the evening we went for the 6:30pm slot.
en-unannotated-01628	Your archetypal Parisian eaterie - authentic and good.
en-unannotated-01629	Even a hardened carnivore loved the fixed menu...
en-unannotated-01630	This is a good app, the whole SoundCloud experience, except one thing: when I click on songs in my stream, it ALWAYS plays the most recently featured track instead.
en-unannotated-01631	The food was incredible, like nothing you've ever tasted before.
en-unannotated-01632	The riverside location is lovely, even on a rainy night.
en-unannotated-01633	We didn't have reservations.
en-unannotated-01634	The hot chocolate is delicious,the pastries amazing,the service great and the prices reasonable.
en-unannotated-01635	Initially we had a reservation for the Tryp Hotel – Usaquen and the welcoming and the rooms were a total disaster.
en-unannotated-01636	Not horrible, but not very memorable.
en-unannotated-01637	In each one of those items the Embassy Suite excels and has high marks.
en-unannotated-01638	He answered yes, exactly!
en-unannotated-01639	Jellyfish is a lovely upscale restaurant with a robust wine selection and fresh seafood.
en-unannotated-01640	We went in and they had live music.
en-unannotated-01641	Was flavorful and not too salty.
en-unannotated-01642	If you visit the park and Arc de Triomf you can eat here.
en-unannotated-01643	The prices are very reasonable, too.
en-unannotated-01644	Tuesday evening , 10 pm, and it was full of people!!!
en-unannotated-01645	Please fix this
en-unannotated-01646	The staff speaks English and the menu has English as well.
en-unannotated-01647	Excellent food and again the Guinness was on point.
en-unannotated-01648	Highly recommended!
en-unannotated-01649	First, I will be back for the goulash!
en-unannotated-01650	Wonderful fish and chips.
en-unannotated-01651	I stayed at this hotel three times in two weeks due to a layover schedule.
en-unannotated-01652	Beautiful hotel, some rooms in need of a little refurbishment.
en-unannotated-01653	Comfortable beds, nice room, art noveau public spaces and exceptional classically decorated bar
en-unannotated-01654	The one thing I don't like is how far can this game possibly go?
en-unannotated-01655	However, the true highlight is the food itself.
en-unannotated-01656	I do love this game but it's obvious when you have loads of coins that u get to play a guest who everyone knows is a computer.
en-unannotated-01657	Smelling toilette and room .
en-unannotated-01658	If you are a big chocolate lover this is a must.
en-unannotated-01659	I spent the week staying across the street from this place but didn't end up going there until my last night, because I thought I should leave Paris having had some proper French food.
en-unannotated-01660	Overall, a 5 star experience!!
en-unannotated-01661	Like I said before: nom, nom, nom.
en-unannotated-01662	The name is misleading, as it sounds like a snack-bar, but it’s actually quite upmarket and serves imaginative, home-cooked food.
en-unannotated-01663	As a tourist, it's not always easy to get all of the above in busy Paris!
en-unannotated-01664	The dining rooms were good and staff were very helpful.
en-unannotated-01665	I would like to choose which countries I want to be paired against.
en-unannotated-01666	I think that's probably true for now although their reviews seemed much too harsh.
en-unannotated-01667	The location was outstanding and made it so easy to explore all over the city.
en-unannotated-01668	If you are looking to go out after dinner, Boxty House is smack dab in the middle of the Temple Bar area and is surrounded by nightlife.
en-unannotated-01669	Also the hot water kettle was not working.
en-unannotated-01670	He said they were the best fries he has ever eaten.
en-unannotated-01671	Great burgers at an even better price.
en-unannotated-01672	This was a very crowed and fun place.
en-unannotated-01673	An extensive wine list, with some modern choices.
en-unannotated-01674	I've always been very fond of Coffeemania, and I do not mean to say that all of their cafes are equally bad.
en-unannotated-01675	i can hear them sing local songs....
en-unannotated-01676	Great food and super friendly and fun staff.
en-unannotated-01677	The tiramisu was heavenly and a great way to top off the meal.
en-unannotated-01678	I needed a confirmed room with two beds that could accommodate my wheelchair bound dad after a long ride.
en-unannotated-01679	We came fairly late, around 9 o'clock and luckily there was a spot for us.
en-unannotated-01680	As a plat, my friend had seared scallops on a bed of risotto, which she said was delicious.
en-unannotated-01681	Had dinner reservations at 8:30pm, restaurant was about 2/3 full but slowly became packed as the evening progressed.
en-unannotated-01682	I hope that changes in future.
en-unannotated-01683	We felt like we were dining in a friends home.
en-unannotated-01684	Tip: reserve an area!
en-unannotated-01685	but no such luck.
en-unannotated-01686	-Beef tartare
en-unannotated-01687	Globally expensive for the facilities available.
en-unannotated-01688	The prices are tad bit on the higher end, ranging from 13-20 euro on the lunch menu and 20 for dinner.
en-unannotated-01689	I went with the guinea fowl and my husband had the poached fish.
en-unannotated-01690	We both ordered an appetizer and a main course along with a half bottle of wine and each one was delicious.
en-unannotated-01691	Messages does not work takes forever to load
en-unannotated-01692	My kids loved the donuts.
en-unannotated-01693	Not working since update on any device
en-unannotated-01694	Edit: your may "bug fix" didn't fix my problem.
en-unannotated-01695	Every dish was tasty but small so it was not excessive though the number of plates was long.
en-unannotated-01696	It was all delicious.
en-unannotated-01697	And she said she didn't know but she didn't think they had that.
en-unannotated-01698	But I felt they lacked variety in the fish.
en-unannotated-01699	Finding a hotel that offers value for money in San Sebastian isn't the easiest of tasks, but Arrizul Congress Hotel turns out to be a good alternative.
en-unannotated-01700	Pho is really fresh and you get a large portion, which makes you feel full for the next 4-5 hours.
en-unannotated-01701	I had roasted vegetables, potatoes and sausages with a beer.
en-unannotated-01702	This was my first Irish meal!
en-unannotated-01703	A bit expensive but valuable ..
en-unannotated-01704	Never knew risotto was suppose to be cooked where each grain has a bite and not mushy.
en-unannotated-01705	My wife and i ate here and the food was very good i had a burger and she had the haloumi sandwhich both were very good and everything is big portions so u wont leave hungry and we also had a tomato soup with pumpkin bread and butter and it was very good aswell.
en-unannotated-01706	The hotel located in very nice and quite area.
en-unannotated-01707	Arrived quite late and many ingredients sold out.
en-unannotated-01708	The secure underground parking was also an advantage, giving peace of mind.
en-unannotated-01709	Great food and ambience.
en-unannotated-01710	This hidden gem might get unappreciated by some tourists but we're obsessed.
en-unannotated-01711	Had to wait for a while until I got served, but when you're not in a hurry that is not a problem.
en-unannotated-01712	We arrived once the restaurant opened (7:30 pm) and were told that we can only eat for an hour at our table as there was a reservation at 8:30. No biggie as the food arrives pretty quickly.
en-unannotated-01713	They come in stacks of 4 small (fist size) discs with toppings layered in between.
en-unannotated-01714	The ceilling height of the meeting room was too low.
en-unannotated-01715	I can't recall if they had a drinks menu but they don't charge corkage so we brought our own which was a nice touch.
en-unannotated-01716	We were given free samples, free drinks and ate more in one sitting than we have in a week!
en-unannotated-01717	And plz let the people in their phone be able to drive because it sucks not be able to drive and not be ablee to use the other gear.
en-unannotated-01718	I played it for a long time and, I would say I got my money's worth.
en-unannotated-01719	I would not hesitate in going back there again!
en-unannotated-01720	Our concierge Sara was splendid, not only did she make us feel right at home , she went above and beyond the norm of most customer services hotels provide.
en-unannotated-01721	You can tease the favor of the ocean but not too salty.
en-unannotated-01722	Thank you
en-unannotated-01723	So you end the evening limoncelloed out and gummy-beared...
en-unannotated-01724	The people who work there are very nice and professional.
en-unannotated-01725	I used to have the Hailo app before it switched to mytaxi.
en-unannotated-01726	This restaurant is ok.
en-unannotated-01727	Although the rooms are rather small and wardrobe area is too small.
en-unannotated-01728	Wound up coming here due to a tram mixup and was extremely satisfied.
en-unannotated-01729	There's also a second restaurant not too far away if you wanted to make the trek over if this one is full.
en-unannotated-01730	My husband and I stayed here last night.
en-unannotated-01731	Beautiful rooms & lovely host.
en-unannotated-01732	Prioritises prebooking to on demand too heavily.
en-unannotated-01733	Wonderful restaurant and great free breakfast.
en-unannotated-01734	Rooms are old and simple.
en-unannotated-01735	the bar tender is dope...
en-unannotated-01736	We sat down for dinner and ordered wine and a beer (Heineken is all they offer). We also ordered the foie gras to start and it was quite delicious.
en-unannotated-01737	Great rooms, but be careful in the shower.
en-unannotated-01738	Very helpful and friendly.
en-unannotated-01739	The food was average, service was great, the staff explained every details and origins of the dish.
en-unannotated-01740	I think there should be an option for feedback as there are a lot of timewasters and pepole should know to bother out not
en-unannotated-01741	I thought earlier in the week i had experienced excellence but in comparison...
en-unannotated-01742	Not really 5 star quality
en-unannotated-01743	Before going here, make sure to make a reservation since the risoelatte is always crowded and fully booked on weekends.
en-unannotated-01744	I didn't really mind it though because it was indicative of how popular and busy they are.
en-unannotated-01745	Nice room, big bed and fairly quiet neighbourhood - at least during the week.
en-unannotated-01746	The room is pretty and clean, all...
en-unannotated-01747	I loved everything!!!
en-unannotated-01748	Well maintained.
en-unannotated-01749	Perfect roof top city view and surprisingly very quiet at night
en-unannotated-01750	You won't be dissatisfied.
en-unannotated-01751	The staff are all extremely friendly and acomdating.
en-unannotated-01752	Superb service the good is fit for foodies !
en-unannotated-01753	Great restaurant.
en-unannotated-01754	We had the escargot, French onion soup, duck breast balsamic, and the foie gras on toast!
en-unannotated-01755	I'm pretty sure they forgot about our main meal, as we saw plenty of people arrive, be served and leave, but we didn't mind as we enjoyed the atmosphere.
en-unannotated-01756	The chef was very kind and sent a beautiful dessert dish.
en-unannotated-01757	Fresh green olives and breads with our red wine, amazing pasta that followed, super friendly service...
en-unannotated-01758	We were the youngest patrons by 2+ decades.
en-unannotated-01759	We ate here twice in one week.
en-unannotated-01760	It was very close to Spanish stairs and all other monuments, the staff was very helpfull, we really enjoyed the stay
en-unannotated-01761	A casual restaurant with great food.
en-unannotated-01762	Nice clean comfortable hotel with excellent service.
en-unannotated-01763	We changed the time a couple of times, we ended up having dinner at 8:45pm (still jet-lagged) and no problem.
en-unannotated-01764	Not even water.
en-unannotated-01765	The foie gras is just so rich and pairs really well with the egg cocotte.
en-unannotated-01766	Orange juice is really nice, very friendly.

en-unannotated-01771	Crispy and delicious.
en-unannotated-01772	The owners spoke with us before we left and were so happy that we enjoyed.
en-unannotated-01773	Staff quite rude too.
en-unannotated-01774	The bf and I grabbed seats first cause it was a little busy and the hostess was very helpful in showing us the available tables.
en-unannotated-01775	10/10 in my opinion

en-unannotated-01780	I would have taken a ton of them back home for my...
en-unannotated-01781	The mousse is light as air and the praline/toffee is impeccable.
en-unannotated-01782	So delicious.
en-unannotated-01783	A polite single waiter who was given our table, with SO much knowledge about the menu so he could cater to any questions or dietary concerns - a sign of fantastic service and going that extra notch forward!
en-unannotated-01784	Waiters were fine.
en-unannotated-01785	But this French dish is amazing.
en-unannotated-01786	amazing pastries to choose from..
en-unannotated-01787	I am a notoriously picky eater & on a recent visit to Ireland & the UK, I knew I might be in for trouble, with such a heavy focus on fish & game & parts of animals I'd much rather see running away from me at a great distance than on my plate.
en-unannotated-01788	) - or even for more - Artrip is THE place to stay.
en-unannotated-01789	The fries served with the lamb and steak were somewhat soggy.

en-unannotated-01797	We went for the 25 course menu.
en-unannotated-01798	What a memorable dinner in Paris!
en-unannotated-01799	Our bolognese pasta was pretty good, but nothing like the flavors at Da Oscar (which maybe raised my standards too high). The steak for our second course was terrible.
en-unannotated-01800	Best meal we have had in a long time and all agreed!
en-unannotated-01801	This is in my opinion the best hotel in Mexico City.
en-unannotated-01802	I played this game for 3 hours straight (do not attempt) but the game never got boring or dull.

en-unannotated-01807	The people there were super cool.
en-unannotated-01808	If you think that you will enjoy learning about Catalan cuisine& culture in a well preserved Catalan apartment, you...
en-unannotated-01809	After reading all the reviews and following people advising I thought it would not be disappointed.
en-unannotated-01810	Off the beaten path a bit but very close to the airport.
en-unannotated-01811	Almost as bad as RTE Player....
en-unannotated-01812	An hour and a half for a dish to be served after its been requested is too long.
en-unannotated-01813	Excellent restaurant, we eat a set lunch menu, that was very good, made with fresh products by the chef.
en-unannotated-01814	Fantastic location in the heart of historic center and high-end shopping district.
en-unannotated-01815	A group of us were on a boat and decided to have a nice beach lunch.
en-unannotated-01816	a beautiful hotel albeit a little tired.
en-unannotated-01817	The small side of fries was truly good with a perfect balance of seasoning and textural crunch.
en-unannotated-01818	Instead we went out to the open rooftop bar and had a few drinks.
en-unannotated-01819	One of the simplest but excelente hotels in my hole life.
en-unannotated-01820	Stayed here for 2 nights for the recent marathon.
en-unannotated-01821	The best drink was an Old Fashioned.
en-unannotated-01822	I got the build-a-burger and didn't use all of the stuff I could have put on it, and still they don't give one ketchup for one's fries--they charge for it.
en-unannotated-01823	The pasta was the most delicious I've ever had in my life!
en-unannotated-01824	We weren't especially hungry, but this was our shot at going back to Agua y Sal.
en-unannotated-01825	The breakfast was to expensive and with limited selection.
en-unannotated-01826	Good if you enjoy sitting on crates and eating in the dark.
en-unannotated-01827	It is really fantastically addictive game.
en-unannotated-01828	Really friendly staff and good atmosphere!
en-unannotated-01829	Staff are knowledgeable, helpful and friendly.
en-unannotated-01830	High recommend the hotel.
en-unannotated-01831	This place is located down a seedy alley way that you might walk past, don't make the mistake of doing so, it's well worth the venture down to check it out.
en-unannotated-01832	Go here, get there early (after 6:30-7 the owner will tell you "not possible" with the greatest accent btw) order yourself some onion soup and thank me later.
en-unannotated-01833	The food is nice and delicious...
en-unannotated-01834	Staff were for the most part friendly and helpful.
en-unannotated-01835	Incredibly fast service, cheap prices, and amazingly delicious food.
en-unannotated-01836	The graphics are perfect and the options are great....
en-unannotated-01837	I can't believe based on their poor service they thought it appropriate to heavily hint they need a tip.
en-unannotated-01838	For our first night in Paris, I made reservations for Comptoir de la Gastronomie.
en-unannotated-01839	So many restaurants come and go so I realized I need to help those who are great survive!
en-unannotated-01840	Fantastic meat, with sauce prepared at the table, c'est tres bon 😋😋😋avec les baby potatoes fried j adore.
en-unannotated-01841	Had the chateubriand which where cooked to perfection.
en-unannotated-01842	Recommended if you like goulash.
en-unannotated-01843	The rooms were huge and had everything you could need, as a whole I think it's a wonderful hotel.
en-unannotated-01844	Highly recommended.
en-unannotated-01845	It hurts my student-sized wallet a little, but that's not to say it's expensive.
en-unannotated-01846	there are good places to eat getting 5 stars(Settembrini 18) on yelp,however, this place is where you need to go.
en-unannotated-01847	The hotel is small and quant.
en-unannotated-01848	I ordered a "Bees Knees" cocktail ($18) which is a delicate and wonderfully balanced blend of The West Winds Sabre Gin, lemon juice, honey and freshly cut Bee One Third honeycomb.
en-unannotated-01849	The service was great and the food was delicious.
en-unannotated-01850	I only upgraded because my version refused to run but did not offer in-app upgrading (should have see trouble ahead right then). You can no longer buy tickets or access your account.
en-unannotated-01851	Complete disaster, they ask you to install an app from their website to play via app but when it needs update it stops working saying that it needs to be updated, but if you update you will get the Google play app which cannot allow for online play.
en-unannotated-01852	My opponent was ran out of time but yet he was playing....
en-unannotated-01853	Second, everyone in there is running around and I actually got a whiff of BO from a server.
en-unannotated-01854	Despite us having a toddler.
en-unannotated-01855	We stayed two nights at this property and couldn't have been happier.
en-unannotated-01856	I opted for the steak medallion boxty and what arrived not much later was a tasty crepe (uh, boxty) wrapped around several delicious pieces of steak (cooked medium rare to order) topped with a white gravy and with a small salad on the side.
en-unannotated-01857	I recommend going with another person and sharing a salad and gratin: the salad is too light for a grown man, but the gratin is too heavy.
en-unannotated-01858	Staff was nice.
en-unannotated-01859	One actually could get perfect as much as he plays, even for the real table.
en-unannotated-01860	Just go in there and order anything at all, it will be fresh and awesome.
en-unannotated-01861	They even weigh your plate before serving some dishes !!!.
en-unannotated-01862	I was really excited to try this sushi place after seeing the reviews, however my boyfriend and I were very disappointed.
en-unannotated-01863	The Spoonik's Chef recomend go to nobook and that i did.
en-unannotated-01864	On the other side of the kitchen is a bar for the less hungry.
en-unannotated-01865	One person serves one cooks and it is great, possibly one of the strongest Gin & tonics I have ever had.
en-unannotated-01866	What a culinary find.
en-unannotated-01867	Works fine in the browser but not the app.
en-unannotated-01868	Entrees averaging 27dollars.
en-unannotated-01869	Foodie heaven!
en-unannotated-01870	Immediately upon sitting we were served a bowl of sundried tomates, rehydrated not dry and tough, a big basket of bread and a bowl of Meatballs in sauce....
en-unannotated-01871	I wonder, why don't you have a simple menu of sandwiches?
en-unannotated-01872	They serve amazing food and offer you atmosphere.
en-unannotated-01873	In the evening the friendly waiter showed us our table in the empty restaurant.
en-unannotated-01874	Newcomer to the Eagle Street Pier dining precinct is Blackbird Bar and Grill and its presence is well deserved.
en-unannotated-01875	The toilet seat lid needs repair.
en-unannotated-01876	Typical hotel for this type.
en-unannotated-01877	The staff was extremely friendly didn't mind us moving from inside to outside in back to inside.
en-unannotated-01878	
en-unannotated-01879	I also noticed that 100% of the guests were American, which was surprising since it's off the beaten path.
en-unannotated-01880	Don't hesitate at all about stopping at this place.
en-unannotated-01881	Funky and modern design.
en-unannotated-01882	I was greeted at the door by our waiter, who was a sweet man and spoke English pretty fluently.
en-unannotated-01883	They also provide a portable WiFi when you go out without any extra cost.
en-unannotated-01884	Gross!
en-unannotated-01885	I must say that this was a very great experience.
en-unannotated-01886	Breakfast buffet is something above average with an excellent selection of great food.
en-unannotated-01887	Also, I have only found one English speaking channel CNN.
en-unannotated-01888	I tried a different beer since I had just come from the Storehouse so I ordered a Hop House 13 Lager which is brewed by Guinness; I was not impressed at all.
en-unannotated-01889	That came as an unexpected and pleasant surprise!
en-unannotated-01890	It is pretty much required that you do a reservation here.
en-unannotated-01891	Their goulash is the best I've had in the city.
en-unannotated-01892	There is an awful smell in the hotel, all of the furniture is outdated and very worn for the price you are paying and it is listed as a 5 star hotel.
en-unannotated-01893	The staff & the concierge   Are friendly & helpful.
en-unannotated-01894	The food rocked, the service was great, and the bill brought a smile to my wallet.
en-unannotated-01895	So if you want to enjoy a nice burger, and even if its packed, just go for the take-out option and get a seat in the closest park.
en-unannotated-01896	The staff was very professional and friendly.
en-unannotated-01897	Room not quite as large as seemed to appear on the pictures; great small terrace was littered with cigarettes.
en-unannotated-01898	I should be able to select the first song and then play.
en-unannotated-01899	Book a table, because not all were as lucky as we were and got a table after just 15 minutes of waiting in line.
en-unannotated-01900	A perfect example of how the Italians take simple, high-quality ingredients and let them shine.
en-unannotated-01901	So memorable it would possibly rival an endless plate of unpasteurized French cheese as my LAST DYING meal.
en-unannotated-01902	Best service you can get in milan.
en-unannotated-01903	The lamb was good.
en-unannotated-01904	Prices were on the pricier side but it is expected when you are the longest standing pub.
en-unannotated-01905	24/7 service and quiet at night.
en-unannotated-01906	Prefect Red onion sauce is not my best choice but feel free to have a go.
en-unannotated-01907	Cozy place.
en-unannotated-01908	None of us missed the meat!
en-unannotated-01909	I`ve spent a week at the Bogota Plaza and it was very good.
en-unannotated-01910	They didn't just throw a bunch of ingredients together and slap on a price and label.
en-unannotated-01911	The escargot were different (in a good way) than what I typically have prepared myself or had at a restaurant in the States.
en-unannotated-01912	Well...
en-unannotated-01913	It wasn't overly sweet, and had tart cherries on the top.
en-unannotated-01914	It's super addictive!!
en-unannotated-01915	Prices for pints and whiskeys will be a bit more than a smaller less popular pub, but you must get yourself a Guinness, and if the Kitchen is open, their Stew is one to write about as well.
en-unannotated-01916	I ordered a gin & tonic with Hendricks ($9) and the others got a James Squire beer from the tap and a lemon, lime and bitters.
en-unannotated-01917	This place is a gastropub, so they don't serve completely traditional Irish food; it's more modern.
en-unannotated-01918	I'm afraid I cannot think of any pros of this hotel.
en-unannotated-01919	The bathroom was a joke.
en-unannotated-01920	Its like a puzzle, it challenges your brain.
en-unannotated-01921	Hotel is run down - clean but quite run down.
en-unannotated-01922	Doesnt not work.
en-unannotated-01923	A meal with a glass of wine and the views of the river and notre dame.
en-unannotated-01924	The staff is very friendly helpful.
en-unannotated-01925	It was the best food I had in Paris.
en-unannotated-01926	The atmosphere was great for our last meal in Italy.
en-unannotated-01927	Hotel is themed very well, I slept in a Mel Gibson themed hotel room.
en-unannotated-01928	Overall, P.Mac's was okay and our server was really sweet and gave great drink and food recommendations.
en-unannotated-01929	Caution!
en-unannotated-01930	A fantastic meal with attentive and personable service.
en-unannotated-01931	The steak nearly melted in my mouth but with a slight hint of texture on the outside.
en-unannotated-01932	It's an authentic local Italian restaurant.
en-unannotated-01933	Im Dublin for a night saw this being recommended on Yelp.
en-unannotated-01934	I feel like being cheated by you.
en-unannotated-01935	I always find it to be chewy and slimy, with an out-of-the-packet taste, and as much as the name excites me on any menu, most times I decide not to order it to avoid disappointment.
en-unannotated-01936	Loved our meal, the deserts are masterpieces!!
en-unannotated-01937	The wine list is short but sharp...
en-unannotated-01938	This is a fantastic little restaurant...
en-unannotated-01939	We asked if we could iron some clothes and they don't offer and iron.
en-unannotated-01940	Great sandwiches and smoothies.
en-unannotated-01941	We recently spent nine days at Historico Central.
en-unannotated-01942	Food is basic but good...
en-unannotated-01943	Accommodation -
en-unannotated-01944	Duck leg with blueberry sauce,Spicy marinated beef roast, grilled salmon and gnocchi with blue cheese, leeks and garlic or potatoes with leeks blue cheese and garlic take your pick the menu is pretty tasty looking and extensive.
en-unannotated-01945	I'd recommend tasting their chocolate bonbons too, very high...
en-unannotated-01946	Went during Bogota Food Week.
en-unannotated-01947	When first arriving the reception area is a bit like the entrance to a night club with it's red walls and big silver light globes and music playing so wondered if we had booked somewhere that attracts the younger generation.
en-unannotated-01948	The duck was cooked well and almost homestyle.
en-unannotated-01949	The worse 5 star hotel, I don't understand how this hotel rated 5 stars, the furniture was very old, the bathroom not clean and stinked , despite the location there is nothing nice about this hotel.
en-unannotated-01950	Coffee experts, great enthusiasm for their product.
en-unannotated-01951	We had special - whole cooked monkfish.
en-unannotated-01952	Re-installing never really fixes the issues & makes you lose all matches/messages.
en-unannotated-01953	Tables in room wasn't clean well, very dusty.
en-unannotated-01954	Room on small side but got everything you need.
en-unannotated-01955	I have one mussel with tomorrow sauce, it's delicious.
en-unannotated-01956	They also bottle coffee for those who are interested in coffee afterhours (which I never understood about Brisbane cafes - I want coffee later in the day too!). By night, they are a bar that I unfortunately never got to try, but they look like they have a good selection of libations!
en-unannotated-01957	The pictures on the web and this site are deceiving.
en-unannotated-01958	The dishes our party had came out perfect, we each cleaned our plates.
en-unannotated-01959	Keeps saying something went wrong please try again later when looking for people to match with.
en-unannotated-01960	- Zero atmosphere;
en-unannotated-01961	I was seated right away when I came in around 8. It was busy enough to feel good but not crowded.
en-unannotated-01962	Sweet potato soup - sweet with a after bite of spice that paired perfectly with my Murphy's Irish Red.
en-unannotated-01963	We happily filled their space...
en-unannotated-01964	Staff very friendly, respondance time to an emergency we had was within reasonable 30 minutes.
en-unannotated-01965	I'm on my Google profile yet can't add them by their unique ID?!?!?
en-unannotated-01966	I had decided on the pears for dessert but [NAME] talked me in to the Chocolate fondant.
en-unannotated-01967	Highly recommend this place to anyone who's seeking out a slightly different taste of Italian cuisine!
en-unannotated-01968	The location was fabulous, many great places to eat and visit within walking distance.
en-unannotated-01969	The ravioli was incredible and the assortment of complimentary candy jars and limoncello at the end was a delicious surprise.
en-unannotated-01970	Stopped in for lunch with tired feet after wandering Prague Castle.
en-unannotated-01971	On previous occasions we had enjoyed an excellent meal at this restaurant.
en-unannotated-01972	This place hit every mark and exceeds them by a mile.
en-unannotated-01973	Poor service.
en-unannotated-01974	The main problem I had , was that the seats were so uncomfortable 😡. This really...
en-unannotated-01975	I mean, they do it right, but definitely not the best there is.
en-unannotated-01976	Blackbird is a well positioned and outstanding addition to the Brisbane food and entertainment scene.
en-unannotated-01977	I am sorry, that wasn't the case and because of that I am writing that for who is going there to be aware with the type of behaviour that is possible to have it in Pmacs.
en-unannotated-01978	bummer.
en-unannotated-01979	spam
en-unannotated-01980	I'm really not sure if this place is overhyped or what.
en-unannotated-01981	Got an upgraded executive suite.
en-unannotated-01982	The restaurant itself is lovely and service was spot on.
en-unannotated-01983	1/ the view: feel like you are on a boat
en-unannotated-01984	I'm on an Android LG K3. I happen to draw a lot, and I sometimes draw digitally.
en-unannotated-01985	The hotel staff are friendly and helpful.
en-unannotated-01986	Breakfast felt uncomfortable a big airy mirrored room were no one spoke.
en-unannotated-01987	Rooms are uneven in size and comfort
en-unannotated-01988	I feel it is high time subway surfers developers should design an application to enable this which may support all hand sets.
en-unannotated-01989	The concierge is so attentive and helpful and recommended very good restaurants and activities.
en-unannotated-01990	But above all, it stands out because of its friendly staff.
en-unannotated-01991	The staff is very nice and the owner is extremely concerned by your comfort.
en-unannotated-01992	Wide variety of teas - can recommend the black tea.
en-unannotated-01993	It was absolutely one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life!
en-unannotated-01994	I highly recommend this fantastic concept & experience.
en-unannotated-01995	I was either lucky, or maybe its just that everything on offer is delicious; my suspicion is the latter.
en-unannotated-01996	Heaps and heaps of ciders available (I think they boast it's the biggest in Brisbane) and the staff are always happy to guide you in selecting a beverage based on your taste.
en-unannotated-01997	They never returned to pour our wine so we did it ourselves.
en-unannotated-01998	I highly recommend for any meal of the day.
en-unannotated-01999	I also liked that you can arrange to have a car pick you up and return you to the airport.
en-unannotated-02000	After reading the reviews on TripAdvisor, I walked 30 minutes to look for this place in the freezing weather.
en-unannotated-02001	One of the highlights was the lamb cooked for 36 hours sous-vide.
en-unannotated-02002	Also sampled some Croatian wine, vinia Laguna
en-unannotated-02003	We arrived at around 12:30 without a reservation and we were lucky to get a seat.
en-unannotated-02004	The Buttermilk Fried Chicken sandwich was crispy and juicy; however, the greens and cabbage on the sandwich were very bitter.
en-unannotated-02005	Outstanding front desk staff - simple check-in, quick to our room.
en-unannotated-02006	at the end, I was practically drinking it, unwilling to let even a drop go to waste.
en-unannotated-02007	The pigs feet appetizer was incredible, and it came with a salad.
en-unannotated-02008	Great friendly staff made this old hotel what it is to compete with new modern equivalents.
en-unannotated-02009	Found this hidden gem just 5 minutes from Plaza Mayor when we were trying to find somewhere for lunch.
en-unannotated-02010	Excellent food, preparation but the thing we lied best was the excellent service and attention to detail.
en-unannotated-02011	The steak was cooked medium rare to perfection and nicely crusted with peppercorns.
en-unannotated-02012	Realizing that time was passing and we'd seen nowhere we fancied, we went back to the Ezeiza.
en-unannotated-02013	Why spoil a nicely working app as Hailo to replace it with something that doesn't work.
en-unannotated-02014	Thanks to fellow Yelp members for suggesting this place!
en-unannotated-02015	We had no reservations but they gave us this tiny tabola in a window.
en-unannotated-02016	Tourist Trap.
en-unannotated-02017	Really solid spot for a chill drink and the location is really accessible.
en-unannotated-02018	Note: I use redmi note 3
en-unannotated-02019	He was extremely attentive and delivered our meal accurately, completely, and timely.
en-unannotated-02020	recommend for sure.
en-unannotated-02021	But first we also tried the croquetas and a nice salad.
en-unannotated-02022	Seating is an arrangement of tables with orange plastic chairs which further add to the vibe.
en-unannotated-02023	The location is perfect, it was unfortunately a very short  stay but I will go back next time I am in Rome!
en-unannotated-02024	I went very close to cloding and they were extremely welcoming.
en-unannotated-02025	My tuna poke was amazing and am already considering​ my return poke.

en-unannotated-02027	Thank you to [NAME] and [NAME] for a great evening
en-unannotated-02028	For the price (cheap!
en-unannotated-02029	I expected a larger room though the terrace made up for the dismal colour.

en-unannotated-02031	thank you - great food, the best service and a great experience...
en-unannotated-02032	Great service and great wine list !!
en-unannotated-02033	The juicy shrimp, the melt-in-your-mouth wagyu strips and the succulent tuna, it all came together in a sensational, flavour abundant dining experience.
en-unannotated-02034	At some point I really should try something else from there, but every time I go I go for that burger.
en-unannotated-02035	Duck breast was overcooked while simultaneously not having enough fat rendered, and had a slight liver funk to it.
en-unannotated-02036	Location
en-unannotated-02037	We love the hotel.
en-unannotated-02038	I was lucky I was with a good friend so the time flew past but it would definitely be awkward if you were in a rush or with someone you wanted to escape from and you have to wait excessive amounts of time for simple food...
en-unannotated-02039	Didn't sleep well...
en-unannotated-02040	DIVINE!
en-unannotated-02041	Everything that we ordered as suggestion by our waiter was absolutely amazing!
en-unannotated-02042	Very well appointed apartment in a central location.
en-unannotated-02043	This was the best place we ate during our weekend getaway in Prague.
en-unannotated-02044	Spaghetti de carbonara is the main dish everyone ordered around us.
en-unannotated-02045	I compliment Judy the mgr.
en-unannotated-02046	By far this was the best hotel of our 2-week travels in Spain and Portugal, far surpassing the Ritz in Lisbon, our other 5-star hotel.
en-unannotated-02047	I couldn't stop eating it!
en-unannotated-02048	If you're looking for a place that will look after you on your first trip to Bogota, this is it.
en-unannotated-02049	Pretty little family restaurant.
en-unannotated-02050	Blanc and very expensive Voss sparkling water
en-unannotated-02051	Most surprisingly, this Courtyard at the International airport ranks right at the top.
en-unannotated-02052	Awesome Atmosphere!!
en-unannotated-02053	Nice atmosphere, large space, ample seating (although don't expect that on a weekend evening), nice decor (loved the legit candelabras) and extremely friendly staff.
en-unannotated-02054	Swimming pool is a little small but clean.
en-unannotated-02055	Surprisingly good.
en-unannotated-02056	Overall, it was a wonderful experience apart from the dim lighting and slightly stuffy space.
en-unannotated-02057	It's VERY SMALL....
en-unannotated-02058	Nice night, great food.
en-unannotated-02059	The fish arrived at the same time of the bread and the butter, so we didn’t have time to relax and...
en-unannotated-02060	I've seen the reviews and it's amazing!!!!!!!
en-unannotated-02061	The host was endlessly helpful; he explained every menu item in detail in clear English, without being asked.
en-unannotated-02062	The overall experience was above and beyond what I expected, fantastic food and in [name] lovely home that interacted with all the guest and the atmosphere was awesome.
en-unannotated-02063	Centrally located and walking distance to many attractions.
en-unannotated-02064	I think it was on of the most interesting and exciting as well as comfortable places we have ever been.
en-unannotated-02065	3 stars.
en-unannotated-02066	And then there was the drinks menu.
en-unannotated-02067	Dinner with the 50ml of wine and a coke was E110 - not terrible for where we were and what we ate.
en-unannotated-02068	com nor other written communications with the Hotel staff.
en-unannotated-02069	It's dark and grungy, the constantly rotating art is hip and cool.
en-unannotated-02070	Course menu with wine pairing was excellent value for quality of food, cooking, and flavors.
en-unannotated-02071	The a la carte menu is a bit pricey but trust me, it is well worth paying 20Euro for cottage pie.
en-unannotated-02072	I recommend this place to eat and drink.
en-unannotated-02073	There's not a whole lot more to add on this restaurant from what's been already written.
en-unannotated-02074	You can't find a more authentic Mexican restaurant anywhere, but what really makes this place a unique is how simple, inexpensive and friendly, the environment is.
en-unannotated-02075	super risotto.
en-unannotated-02076	Also, they are very informative to non Italian speakers.
en-unannotated-02077	This hotel was modern and located in a good area.
en-unannotated-02078	- Booked a room with twin beds, got a room with a double bed.
en-unannotated-02079	I had the veal and the wife had the Hake.
en-unannotated-02080	I skipped it the first day I...
en-unannotated-02081	I ordered the pork knee (knuckle) with horseradish and mustard and grilled veggies.
en-unannotated-02082	The duck entree was the highlight of our food in Paris.
en-unannotated-02083	For sure!
en-unannotated-02084	This is a well located hotel in a quieter part of the town but overlooking the beach - excellent views.
en-unannotated-02085	There's a tiny sign off Charlotte street and you have to navigate through a building with a Koala rescue organization (and pass a giant koala) in order to find it.
en-unannotated-02086	The staff was very very helpful and kind.
en-unannotated-02087	The building looks like an old palace, very impressive.
en-unannotated-02088	i love how the chef...
en-unannotated-02089	A wonderful seafood taco joint.
en-unannotated-02090	It was however, the Dumplings that were the worst.
en-unannotated-02091	I am gon go lie down now cuz the meat sweat is kicking in.........
en-unannotated-02092	Since you updated it it's useless
en-unannotated-02093	We had a very pleasant stay here.
en-unannotated-02094	You have to order in line with a paper menu and then the waiters will find you a seat after...
en-unannotated-02095	Food was good.
en-unannotated-02096	Again the service is just great kudos to the staff
en-unannotated-02097	The location is amazing, just at the spanish steps and alao at good shopping area and has good cafes just by the corner
en-unannotated-02098	It had such lovely macarons that we had return again to buy gifts to take back home!
en-unannotated-02099	The wifi just doesn't work -- cuts in and out every five minutes.
en-unannotated-02100	For desert we chose two dishes.
en-unannotated-02101	Selected wines match perfectly with all dishes....
en-unannotated-02102	One of the best restaurant in Ajaccio
en-unannotated-02103	SO good.
en-unannotated-02104	situation is perfect.
en-unannotated-02105	This sounds like a lot of food but the popcorn shrimp the wagyu new-style are starters designed to share.
en-unannotated-02106	Also you can swipe up diagonally and it will spin a lot faster.
en-unannotated-02107	First thing I noticed is that there is a LOT of people and only 3 tables.
en-unannotated-02108	We had the duck from the hot pintxo menu and it was sublime.
en-unannotated-02109	Cozy atmosphere.
en-unannotated-02110	They don't have any tables outside though.
en-unannotated-02111	Great location.
en-unannotated-02112	A venture into the unknown to some extent as you only choose the length of the experience without knowing each dish prior to its arrival, though for us this...
en-unannotated-02113	Room are nice.
en-unannotated-02114	After last update stop syncing.
en-unannotated-02115	Recommended by friends and we were not disappointed - great spot by the window prompt service delicious food and a very reasonable bill!
en-unannotated-02116	I have rated it 3 stars,  i can rate it 4 if u add some good sound effects in it.
en-unannotated-02117	The food is also grandmother worthy.
en-unannotated-02118	A great spot for on the northside.
en-unannotated-02119	The service...
en-unannotated-02120	Do not shy away from the non sweet pancakes, they are amazing!
en-unannotated-02121	What's with the charges all of a sudden?
en-unannotated-02122	One other thing of importance is that there are a couple La Cordonnerie restaurants in Paris, so be careful when using Uber or iMaps that you have the right one.
en-unannotated-02123	Let some space for dessert, all of those are delicious!!
en-unannotated-02124	This was one of my favorite meals/restaurants during my visit to Paris.
en-unannotated-02125	We lived thru 9/11 so we understand.
en-unannotated-02126	It was great as well.
en-unannotated-02127	The starters were good- we had the french oignon soup and tuna tartare.
en-unannotated-02128	Had a fantastic meal as we wanted a great seafood meal in Corsica and didn't disappoint, was quiet as Sunday lunch and that's change over day so was not crowded
en-unannotated-02129	The owner came to our table as well to make sure we were happy with our meals.
en-unannotated-02130	We ordered the seared foie gras, the biggest one we have ever seen and one whole piece of large foie gras is very special.
en-unannotated-02131	Luckily we were able to snag a table.
en-unannotated-02132	Food was average but good.
en-unannotated-02133	The staff were all so sweet!
en-unannotated-02134	The reception staff was very friendly and helpful.
en-unannotated-02135	Not flexible and no customer orientation.
en-unannotated-02136	So I will condense it to the following: Nase Maso is extraordinary example of the expression of an artisan craft.
en-unannotated-02137	And it is still absolutely worth to be visit.
en-unannotated-02138	I had the same concerns as other yelpers, it seems Americans tend to frequent the little bistro just if not maybe more than the French, which is in my mind intriguing, bordering worrying.
en-unannotated-02139	The hotel is an oasis in a busy and fascinating city.
en-unannotated-02140	Room was large, elegant and comfortable.
en-unannotated-02141	The riffle is the BEST dessert.
en-unannotated-02142	Very reasonable prices for Paris and a warm atmosphere.
en-unannotated-02143	Vibe- good dining surrounding but sometime s it can be crazily noisy.
en-unannotated-02144	I really like spotify but there is one feature it's missing.
en-unannotated-02145	They quickly took our order and brought out our appetizers and our bottle of wine.
en-unannotated-02146	However it is popular and if you want to guarantee a table I would recommend booking.
en-unannotated-02147	Rooms was poorly Maintained.
en-unannotated-02148	I have been waiting for Suki to open for ages and not w it's open I have a slight addiction!
en-unannotated-02149	Great service, best goulash !!!!!
en-unannotated-02150	My wife recommended this place after seeing good reviews, although we sort of regret it after the fact.
en-unannotated-02151	its fun to plat and one of my favourite ways to kill time.
en-unannotated-02152	We were holding 2 platters of food, and had no idea where to go to eat them.
en-unannotated-02153	The meal was paired with some excellent wines and as other reviewers have mentioned, the menu...
en-unannotated-02154	The meal was split to represent both molecular and classic catalan dishes and was paced over a few hours- guests were locals and foreigners and we through the night made some friends and ended up leaving this dinner for a bar to a disco to...
en-unannotated-02155	It was expensive and of coarse not recommended to buy wines from a restaurant but since she was on a time constraint, she was happy to pay the extra amount and get the best bottle to take back.
en-unannotated-02156	Rooms are good value, clean, well decorated with modern finishes.
en-unannotated-02157	Nd to add chat what we want to say to every one not just fb frmds..
en-unannotated-02158	What a cute little restaurant!
en-unannotated-02159	I asked my server to have my steak cooked well done but not dry.
en-unannotated-02160	From spectacular food to the decor and feeling of being treated like a special person.
en-unannotated-02161	Enjoy
en-unannotated-02162	As for the beef filet, it was slightly more cooked than I would've wanted (closer to medium-well than medium), but it was still very moist!
en-unannotated-02163	All the food here is amazing and if you like your seafood then you definitely need to give it a try.
en-unannotated-02164	My friend and I went here yesterday to try it out because we had heard so much about this place.
en-unannotated-02165	By 9 several other diners had made their way in.
en-unannotated-02166	Friend ordered the bread bowl and I got the pork knuckle.
en-unannotated-02167	We selected a Miso pork belly and designed a beast with beef, Spanish onion, grilled capsicum, tomato, cheddar and blue cheese sauce (extra $3). The Miso wasn't the tender pork belly I was expecting but had a more shredded barbecued pork flavour to it.
en-unannotated-02168	For someone looking to download this app, just dont.
en-unannotated-02169	..
en-unannotated-02170	After the first one, we decided it would be a great idea to eat.
en-unannotated-02171	Well i went to that section of the app by tapjoy and i completed an offer for 50thousand and some change but never recieved my reward :/ so little salty about that but other than that great game
en-unannotated-02172	The location was superb....
en-unannotated-02173	I finished the whole thing!
en-unannotated-02174	A city of gastronomic and good wines.
en-unannotated-02175	You have to stand in a queue with a tray and then go around the tables in search of a free one.
en-unannotated-02176	I want more!
en-unannotated-02177	They always had a problem with the ovens in the kitchen.
en-unannotated-02178	While the sausage was very good, served with bread and mustard, the steaks were good but not very remarkable.
en-unannotated-02179	We had beers and a margarita, great service, excellent flavours and a nice spot to hang out!
en-unannotated-02180	Some albums are missing.
en-unannotated-02181	Doorman was very polite
en-unannotated-02182	We waited at the bar for a seat on the balcony area.
en-unannotated-02183	The best coffee is Brisbane CBD.
en-unannotated-02184	The hotel lacks in basic amenities.
en-unannotated-02185	I would not recommend this place.
en-unannotated-02186	Fantastic food!
en-unannotated-02187	I stayed at 84DC for 8 nights after it was recommended to me by friends.
en-unannotated-02188	I've always been a fan of lavender boiled sweets, but this was different altogether.
en-unannotated-02189	Great atmosphere and food.
en-unannotated-02190	Eaten here twice.
en-unannotated-02191	Breakfast and snack should be improved.
en-unannotated-02192	Great place to sell your stuff.
en-unannotated-02193	Never have I experienced a hotel that is so distant from what I had assumed based on the provided information at the time of reservation.
en-unannotated-02194	Perfect location, very easy to reach from the station/airport.
en-unannotated-02195	Would highly recommend eating here and booking it's facilities for any occasion that needs a touch of class.
en-unannotated-02196	As it's truffle season, there is also an option to have freshly shaved truffle added to any dish for $20 which I was tempted by!
en-unannotated-02197	i ordered a portion of food...
en-unannotated-02198	This is why I love Yelp had best meal with very good roast pork.
en-unannotated-02199	Couldnt ask for much better than this.
en-unannotated-02200	It's been on my phone ever since.
en-unannotated-02201	Could not have been happier.
en-unannotated-02202	YUMMY!
en-unannotated-02203	Very good
en-unannotated-02204	Idk what this is, I'm an American who knows california food pretty well as well as Asian.
en-unannotated-02205	My favorite was the baked brie with rasberry jam.
en-unannotated-02206	The best option is probably the orange bench outside of the next-door restaurant called Sisters, but it's still not a particularly relaxing meal.
en-unannotated-02207	I first stumbled upon Nase Maso in June of 2015. As my friend and I were heading to another restaurant, we noticed a long line snaking out the door and countless people devouring various meat dishes.
en-unannotated-02208	We spent just one night at the Gran Hotel to experience the grandeur of a different time, so my advice: take the old lifts (accompanied by attendant), visit the roof top bar, look down at the fantastic interior from any level..
en-unannotated-02209	There are only like three things on their menu- mussels, calamar and patatas bravas- so dont go lookin for steamed veggies!
en-unannotated-02210	Ridiculous prices, still think that they overcharging the clients (3 ceacer salads - 95 Euro),
en-unannotated-02211	The location is excellent.
en-unannotated-02212	We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and took the 14 course lunch.
en-unannotated-02213	This is a lovely little restaurant on the quay in Bonifacio.
en-unannotated-02214	I'm a freak for radishes so when I saw a plate of them with salt I was a little over excited.
en-unannotated-02215	Wonderful place for a romantic evening!
en-unannotated-02216	Very nice size TV.
en-unannotated-02217	Only issue I have is no offline mode.
en-unannotated-02218	No side mirror
en-unannotated-02219	Midway through my main course, two rowdy men in their late 40s/early 50s were seated next to me and proceeded to wildly gesticulate, place their drinks on my table and the one on the opposite side to me had his arm draped over the chair at my table across from mine.
en-unannotated-02220	That's needs 2 be fixed asap!
en-unannotated-02221	Went here for my last meal in Europe, and I have to say, it was my BEST meal.
en-unannotated-02222	If you look for a place to enjoy a good quality cup of coffee from an italian...
en-unannotated-02223	The staff was friendly and helpful.
en-unannotated-02224	I've never had a bad experience here and rave about it, going there every chance I get and dragging friends who very quickly are also converted.
en-unannotated-02225	I would recommend this to any of my friends coming to Paris.
en-unannotated-02226	Then I ordered a cafe creme to cap off my meal.
en-unannotated-02227	Must try a vanilla ice cream with pistachio and hot chocolate.
en-unannotated-02228	The staff is super friendly.
en-unannotated-02229	As the Boxty House is in the Temple bar area, it's going to be pretty heavy with the tourist trade.
en-unannotated-02230	8 ball pool 4 life..
en-unannotated-02231	I hope to return.
en-unannotated-02232	During my 4 month stay in Prague, I have to say this place was my go-to to satisfy my meat-lover's appitite, and it has to be because of the fresh quality of the meat!
en-unannotated-02233	Great food, great service, great beer.
en-unannotated-02234	We went there on our first evening in Boniface and we had a savory crèpe.
en-unannotated-02235	The room was fantastic, with all the comforts one expects at such top-end hotel.
en-unannotated-02236	They were ok ...
en-unannotated-02237	As part of the planning for our Paris trip, I'd been regularly checking out the TA ratings for the best restaurants in Paris.
en-unannotated-02238	I hope it becomes okay soon.
en-unannotated-02239	You then get in line where cooks are frying seafood in large oil vats.
en-unannotated-02240	Service is snappy and perfect, and each dish is served with a full explanation (in English or French)...
en-unannotated-02241	I stayed here for 3 nights - the hotel is in an absolutely perfect location to explore San Sebastián.
en-unannotated-02242	I did not have reservation but my Airbnb host highly recommended this place (I asked for local, non touristy and walking distance from the apartment) I came to dine here alone at the ripe time of 1030pm (after overnighting in Bergamo the previous night and lunching in Parma the same day and ran around Milan to see the tourist spots; this was a first visit - yeah , that unabated heady mix of exuberance even after Malta and Reykjavik and Amsterdam weeks before, why stop?!) and the place was still full.
en-unannotated-02243	What a great refuge from the rain!
en-unannotated-02244	Make sure you ask that question.
en-unannotated-02245	Well prepared, thoughtfully presented.
en-unannotated-02246	This place was recommended by a cab driver who said "it's a great old pub, if you don't mind the splinters!"
en-unannotated-02247	This didn't detract from my experience.
en-unannotated-02248	As a main, I had the corned beef and cabbage with potato dumplings.
en-unannotated-02249	It tasted great and was very tender.
en-unannotated-02250	My husband ordered the roast beef and I had the duck leg.
en-unannotated-02251	The champagne and wine suggestions were excellent as well !!
en-unannotated-02252	It was delicious.
en-unannotated-02253	I love the pancakes here so much that I returned twice in 4 days.
en-unannotated-02254	I can't really find the words to express our experience at this place.
en-unannotated-02255	Try the cider!
en-unannotated-02256	They have made the whole place look like any proper grandma's house.
en-unannotated-02257	Wow.
en-unannotated-02258	Looked like 90% of the patrons were Mexican natives.
en-unannotated-02259	Overall it is good.
en-unannotated-02260	Very nice hotel in the wonderdul luxury shopping area.
en-unannotated-02261	Once arrived you have to ring the doorbel of the appartmentblock...
en-unannotated-02262	Lunch menu is extensive and surprisingly affordable.
en-unannotated-02263	The staff was trully amazing and polite and whatever I asked was more than willing to help.
en-unannotated-02264	Remember to also try the Kozel beer which is a stout!
en-unannotated-02265	Apartment was very nice as well and for sure value for money
en-unannotated-02266	The smoked duck was soft and fell apart on bite, the foie grass was rich yet not overpowering and the gizzards, well you wouldn't even know you were eating them.
en-unannotated-02267	Reasonable price, authentic plates.
en-unannotated-02268	Then this is your place.
en-unannotated-02269	Portions aren't huge but they aren't tiny either.
en-unannotated-02270	Wow, that was some serious good stuff, served with avocado spread, a slaw, lettuce and right amount of spice.
en-unannotated-02271	Also tried to Seafood Lunch Buffet which was excellent as well.
en-unannotated-02272	Buffet breakfast could be included, this is something that could improve image.
en-unannotated-02273	We visited Loly earlier this year and was greeted with warmth and friendship, she is a wonderful interesting lady who lives in a delightful Parisian flat - and she cooks the most amazing food!!!!
en-unannotated-02274	I was at Coffeemania and the staff were really polite and nice - I speak limited Russian!
en-unannotated-02275	The younger gentleman comes back and informs us that the order was forgotten and was never placed into the system.
en-unannotated-02276	Order what they call the veggie couscous: multiple veggies riced into a well seasoned couscous like side dish without any grain.
en-unannotated-02277	Breakfast had lots of choices.
en-unannotated-02278	It tasted good!
en-unannotated-02279	staff hotel was kind and helpful, the food was delicious and you can find different options in their menu....
en-unannotated-02280	With that being said, just make sure you're in good copy where the conversation can be endless!
en-unannotated-02281	It was not closed.
en-unannotated-02282	Alles war einfach perfect.
en-unannotated-02283	Come for the cheese gratin!!!
en-unannotated-02284	The second night had a small misunderstanding about when to bring out each course but that was ok.
en-unannotated-02285	collect coins.
en-unannotated-02286	It was a pleasure to stay at the Hampton Inn.
en-unannotated-02287	We stayed at the Atlantico in May.
en-unannotated-02288	The cappuccino and the macchiato taste exactly as the one you would get in Italy, if not better, and the sweet, freshly baked on premises, are to die for....
en-unannotated-02289	This restaurant is absolutely must to go!
en-unannotated-02290	A bit noisy at night due to central location and old original windows.
en-unannotated-02291	Hotel so cosy and elegant.
en-unannotated-02292	I would highly recommend the wine pairings - in some restaurants they can be a bit of a let down, but we really enjoyed the pairings at Con Gracia - interesting choices which complimented the courses...
en-unannotated-02293	Wine selection is great, however the cocktails are a bit lacking.
en-unannotated-02294	We came to this pizzeria for a quick slice of pizza before heading home.
en-unannotated-02295	But deserving of a 5 overall.
en-unannotated-02296	Thanks to alll...
en-unannotated-02297	I picked this place because of other reviews and was not disappointed.
en-unannotated-02298	You choose how much...
en-unannotated-02299	The location was the only positive about this hotel
en-unannotated-02300	This is the place to experience the unique TripAdvisor members’ club restaurant atmosphere, made possible by reserving a table online with the help of TripAdvisor.
en-unannotated-02301	As a lunch place (good sushi) sitting near the front with a great daytime view it was great (lunch pricing was better) but for dinner its about what you would expect but nothing more.
en-unannotated-02302	My wife and I stayed at Hotel Preciados for 4 days in mid-May 2017. The hotel is very convenient to all of the sights in Madrid and great to use as a base for exploring.
en-unannotated-02303	The free desktop version allows this so what makes you think changing how the app functions is a good idea?
en-unannotated-02304	Lovely hipster area of Brerea.
en-unannotated-02305	We also ordered the pasta with bottarga and anchovy in butter - if you love the super fishy taste then you'll love this.
en-unannotated-02306	After the amazing meal, we had to get dessert.
en-unannotated-02307	All meals were excellent perfectly seasoned.
en-unannotated-02308	- Overall terrible quality, wouldn't recommend to anyone.
en-unannotated-02309	Highly recommended and right on the money.
en-unannotated-02310	Location,,,
en-unannotated-02311	Relaxed vibe, good value, tasty food.
en-unannotated-02312	The indoor pool was sufficient.
en-unannotated-02313	On top of the great food, you will enjoy a very nice atmosphere, friendly waiters (some...
en-unannotated-02314	So I have now been to this warm, welcoming, delicious restaurant about a dozen times since my first visit in 2013 and my first review in 2015. It continues to be a real icon of an Italian restaurant.
en-unannotated-02315	Without a doubt an intimate personalized culinary magic carpet ride.
en-unannotated-02316	Add to this a wonderful view to Ajaccio's gulf and you are all set for a memorable evening!
en-unannotated-02317	Great location, the most comfortable bed ever, excellent customer service.
en-unannotated-02318	I ordered the egg cocotte foie gras, duck confit shepherd's pie, and Creme brûlée.
en-unannotated-02319	Pretty extensive menu not sure if a husband and wife team but for a small kitchen area they certainly know what they are doing.
en-unannotated-02320	We picked a street view rooms so if you stay in the room at these hours it can be annoying as they don't stop until 8pm but still it is not the hotel's fault and we kind of enjoyed it.
en-unannotated-02321	Plus, the food...
en-unannotated-02322	That would be cliche and verbose.
en-unannotated-02323	The risotto was super creamy with the rice cooked perfectly and the scallops basically melting in my mouth (just thinking about how good it was is like sweet torture). My friend ordered one of their specialty meals of the day (a seafood dish) from the board that was hanging in the restaurant & she really seemed to enjoy her meal as well.
en-unannotated-02324	Prices: 4 stars
en-unannotated-02325	We attended a concert at Express Live downtown and the location of the hotel was a quick $13 Uber ride to the venue.
en-unannotated-02326	We are from America, so when I ordered a cup of coffee, I learned that our version of a "drip coffee" wasn't on the menu.
en-unannotated-02327	This place is amazing.
en-unannotated-02328	It's that one meal, where you think, hmm, maybe this time I should branch out, try something different?
en-unannotated-02329	So good!
en-unannotated-02330	The restaurant has a very nice ambience and is nicely decorated.
en-unannotated-02331	Returned again to this hotel last week for our 3rd time.
en-unannotated-02332	Loved our stay at Splendom Suites Gran Via!
en-unannotated-02333	Clean, large, comfortable rooms.
en-unannotated-02334	Cider list is next level so go get your scrumpy on!
en-unannotated-02335	GET AMONGST THE FREE STUFF.
en-unannotated-02336	Staff was excellent.
en-unannotated-02337	The lemon and cucumber sauce were delicious too, and made the dish less heavy.
en-unannotated-02338	The only regret that I have is that we were both too full to sample their dessert offerings.
en-unannotated-02339	Get the Mr Brightside Cocktail and watch the theatre of the smoke emerge from the glass.
en-unannotated-02340	We were so excited to try it and it definitely exceeded our expectations.
en-unannotated-02341	I had the spiced lamb with nori and pickles...
en-unannotated-02342	Startlingly good pasta in this small, local pasta shop.
en-unannotated-02343	One of the best meals I had in Mexico City.
en-unannotated-02344	I had the soft soft shell crab which was amazing, and for desert a flaming creme brule that was just to die for!
en-unannotated-02345	The coffee was good and it wasn't crowded which was nice.
en-unannotated-02346	This gastronomic experience is just amazing!!
en-unannotated-02347	The location is great.
en-unannotated-02348	I want that much fast in the start also plz
en-unannotated-02349	Very hip.
en-unannotated-02350	John Mills is by now well known for its back-alley location, great coffee, great staff, and great cocktails.
en-unannotated-02351	Location is perfect for a short visit, staff are helpful and always on hand.
en-unannotated-02352	Thin walls you can hear everything
en-unannotated-02353	The...
en-unannotated-02354	and the Limoncello....
en-unannotated-02355	fresh local products and home-made pasta are of excellent quality.
en-unannotated-02356	Fantastic restaurant.
en-unannotated-02357	You can reserve a table, but my Czech is somewhat lacking to do so by phone, so I took my chances.
en-unannotated-02358	Must stop in Paris!
en-unannotated-02359	Everything from the welcome all the way through the goodbye were...
en-unannotated-02360	I was hungry, and stuff wasn't tasty at all.
en-unannotated-02361	One other thing that my wife and I liked was their 1/2 bottle wine selections.
en-unannotated-02362	Pork knee - crunchy ass skin, so BOMB.
en-unannotated-02363	Really enjoyed visiting this hotel.
en-unannotated-02364	Service: professional and friendly
en-unannotated-02365	I really dont like whats happening.
en-unannotated-02366	Enjoyed the relish very much.
en-unannotated-02367	* book in advance!
en-unannotated-02368	On our first day in Ajaccio he offered us the local Pietra beer, and we spent the rest of the holiday across the island searching it out.
en-unannotated-02369	The staff are very polite, helpful and service is quick, efinitely worth it though.
en-unannotated-02370	I am just visiting Mexico, so I may not have best comparison.
en-unannotated-02371	They offer a wide selection of alcoholic drinks which I did not get to try as it was only 9:30 in the morning.
en-unannotated-02372	Yum, such a great combination of sweet and salty, though maybe there could have been some more syrup.
en-unannotated-02373	I stayed in this hotel by business/leisure trip to Madrid during the month of June, 2016. It was a great choice and very convenient.
en-unannotated-02374	The decor is modern and tasteful.
en-unannotated-02375	The staff were very friendly and accommodating.
en-unannotated-02376	The gnocchi was very good, the schnitzel not so much.
en-unannotated-02377	The main area of the restaurant has around 15 tables and...
en-unannotated-02378	Really good surprise in this area.
en-unannotated-02379	Jeez, I just wanna watch the game
en-unannotated-02380	Absolutely love this game, very well developed.
en-unannotated-02381	The breakfast area is lovely and the terrace is also nice to relax.
en-unannotated-02382	I was quite disappointed with the meal I had there.
en-unannotated-02383	If you are looking to eat in a classy and upscale restaurant for breakfast then this is the place for you.
en-unannotated-02384	I did not fancy the crunchy potato straws as a side to that.
en-unannotated-02385	Venue is right on the riverfront which is great for people watching.
en-unannotated-02386	But mine were still good!
en-unannotated-02387	We had a large bottle of the White Gypsy Imperial Stout.
en-unannotated-02388	Flowery plates, old pictures, apples in small bowles on the tables, an old TV, old vacuumer and even old laundry.
en-unannotated-02389	It doesn't hurt that the cookies were good as well.
en-unannotated-02390	The staff was unfortunately not fluent in english but helpful non the less.
en-unannotated-02391	Just the location
en-unannotated-02392	Very good experience.
en-unannotated-02393	Excellent room and bathroom, great location, staff where very friendly and helpful, made us feel welcome, made our stay!
en-unannotated-02394	We found this restaurant on Yelp and thoroughly enjoyed our meal there.
en-unannotated-02395	Clean, modern hotel.
en-unannotated-02396	2. They weren't very english friendly, had no english menu and it always made me feel uncomfortable having to ask for help with the menu to the cashier with 20 people behind me inline so I would only nervously point to something on the board with only the slightest idea of what I was ordering and would cross my finger and hope I hadn't ordered something I wouldn't like.
en-unannotated-02397	PERIOD!
en-unannotated-02398	I highly recommend Boxty House
en-unannotated-02399	hotel well located , I had a quick sevice for dinner.
en-unannotated-02400	The fish in it was chewy and vegetables were quite messy.
en-unannotated-02401	Sake has counterparts in Melbourne and Sydney and I can't wait to check these out.
en-unannotated-02402	Some of the bell door men nice persons and the housekeeping....
en-unannotated-02403	40 euros for the food, a glass of wine, and an espresso afterwards.
en-unannotated-02404	I stayed at the St Regis for a night with my boyfriend.
en-unannotated-02405	It was awkward and weird and obviously super rude.
en-unannotated-02406	Oh well.
en-unannotated-02407	Would stay there again.
en-unannotated-02408	With all that beautiful feeling.
en-unannotated-02409	Our room was on the ground floor with a mini garden.
en-unannotated-02410	Take your family, your friends or impress that date.
en-unannotated-02411	Pork sirloin - amazing
en-unannotated-02412	I would highly recommend the cabbage pancakes as it reminded us of potato rosti which we love.
en-unannotated-02413	All dishes are great.
en-unannotated-02414	It was an absolute pleasure staying here.
en-unannotated-02415	Make reservations or you'll run the risk of not having a table - the restaurant is very small.
en-unannotated-02416	We felt quite at home and comfortable very quickly.
en-unannotated-02417	Would I recommend this place?
en-unannotated-02418	Lovely old world building.
en-unannotated-02419	The room was very nice, service was excellent, It was very clean, the restaurant was good.
en-unannotated-02420	From start to finish this was a fabulous evening.
en-unannotated-02421	Hands down the best food and service I've had in Paris.
en-unannotated-02422	I'm so happy that I discovered this place and actually walked in the alleyway that day..
en-unannotated-02423	I'd probably go back but I wouldn't make it a priority.
en-unannotated-02424	Highly recommended!
en-unannotated-02425	equipment was out of order 😳😳. Hope management will read this review
en-unannotated-02426	First off, there is a good selection of beers on tap (it was especially nice to see O'Hara's stout--I mean, Dublin is Dublin, but there's only so much Guinness I could drink in one trip), with a few examples of each major style.
en-unannotated-02427	Next to Sta Ana square.
en-unannotated-02428	Having seen how massive the pasta portions are (1 pasta definitely feeds 2), we decided to order the meat platter and the gnocchi alla Oscar to share.
en-unannotated-02429	Unfortunately this place has been reading its own press clippings.
en-unannotated-02430	We've stayed at your property 2 or 3 times in as many years.
en-unannotated-02431	If considering this ...
en-unannotated-02432	For those in need of a decent flat white this place is top of list.
en-unannotated-02433	Prices are quite good and not touristy.
en-unannotated-02434	The food and drinks are pretty good and the staff are very friendly.
en-unannotated-02435	So get in early!
en-unannotated-02436	Now takes 10 mins to get anything if at all.
en-unannotated-02437	a regret of that good food and service
en-unannotated-02438	Besides that, AMAZING place!
en-unannotated-02439	The food was one of the best meals we have had here in Paris.
en-unannotated-02440	Great little restaurant with good atmosphere.
en-unannotated-02441	Very welcoming and a buzzy busy atmosphere.
en-unannotated-02442	Good beds and clean facilities, good breakfast.
en-unannotated-02443	I had a really awful experience with this hotel and neither they nor Trip Advisor/ Getaroom seem to care.
en-unannotated-02444	Oscar is a great chef, the staff was really friendly, crowded busy place where time flies!
en-unannotated-02445	If beer is your bag they've got a huge selection.
en-unannotated-02446	They add €2 to your bill for some paper bag with cold bread in it (no butter, nothing, if you want olive oil you gotta ask them to bring it to your table) but I guess that's the same way they do it all over Italy, it's their way of making people pay at least a minimum tip (like we do with 15 and sometimes even 18% in Miami).
en-unannotated-02447	This place was pack on a Sunday afternoon while a lot of others restaurants were close.
en-unannotated-02448	they taste a bit like old fashioned popcorn :)
en-unannotated-02449	Lovely modern rooms one block from the zocalo.
en-unannotated-02450	Foods are exceptional and the service is 5 stars.
en-unannotated-02451	We enjoyed the duck and the sea bass with a sancere-style wine paring.
en-unannotated-02452	You get a delicious, one-of-a-kind burger and chips for $13-$15 which makes this the best burger deal in town by far.
en-unannotated-02453	My wife got the steak with challots, which has already been reviewed about multiple times and was very good.
en-unannotated-02454	It was cooked to perfection.
en-unannotated-02455	I will definetly come back!
en-unannotated-02456	Its just 2 minutes walk to the beach as well as the Church.
en-unannotated-02457	Warmly recommended.
en-unannotated-02458	You will...
en-unannotated-02459	Pros: the ability to personalize the backdrop (temp outside, news, pictures time, etc), the size of the device, the amount of apps that support the device, and not needing an additional remote for the TV.
en-unannotated-02460	Loved it!
en-unannotated-02461	I look forward to coming back for dinner sometime and try the wine list.
en-unannotated-02462	If you're looking for breakfast in Old Town Prague this is a must try.
en-unannotated-02463	you need to get this!
en-unannotated-02464	The calamari were obviously from a freezer bag and the sweet potato fries had parts of rot in the them.
en-unannotated-02465	This place always has a que out the door and down the road.
en-unannotated-02466	Dinner service didn't start until 7:30 and we showed up at 7:00, not realizing.
en-unannotated-02467	We loved the food.
en-unannotated-02468	The menu is reasonably priced and delicious.
en-unannotated-02469	Great place just off the Gran Via, we shared a strawberry cheesecake and walnut brownie and coffee, tasty, clean stylish place good service, some English spoken, free WiFi.
en-unannotated-02470	Adequate breakfast buffet with eggs made to order.
en-unannotated-02471	This is an excellent casual choice.
en-unannotated-02472	I ordered two cakes, coffee and some milshakes, I loved the environment as well as the location.
en-unannotated-02473	Once inside, you'll get a really warm welcome from the staff and instantly feel chilled out...
en-unannotated-02474	Bless the waitresses, they really respected my uneducated choice.
en-unannotated-02475	Pay-per-view English movies and an omelette chef at breakfast were bonuses on top of everything else you'd expect from a 5 star hotel.
en-unannotated-02476	if we promised to finish within the hour...
en-unannotated-02477	Facilities are up to date.
en-unannotated-02478	COM". It was PRE-PAID and clearly listed on my Confirmation and "hotels.
en-unannotated-02479	Don't bother if you want good Italian food.
en-unannotated-02480	Overall, great food, nice atmosphere and good service.
en-unannotated-02481	They look after those in the luxury suites etc.
en-unannotated-02482	Sublime!!!
en-unannotated-02483	The restaurant is very pleasant with mood lighting and soft music.
en-unannotated-02484	Very very small shower with fixed head
en-unannotated-02485	I love a good 80s hit but perhaps not before the second bottle of wine :)
en-unannotated-02486	Restaurant has great food and drinks for those staying on business and not looking to get out and fight the traffic.
en-unannotated-02487	Not sure why people bitch about the food - I've only ever been served tasty awesomeness.
en-unannotated-02488	If you're coming for a date, avoid unless you...
en-unannotated-02489	My god, best decision ever!
en-unannotated-02490	Very kind of him)
en-unannotated-02491	There was not too much flavor to the fish alone.
en-unannotated-02492	It has a super classy feel to it.
en-unannotated-02493	We finished with some coffee and dessert.
en-unannotated-02494	All burgers come with a good enough amount of chips as well.
en-unannotated-02495	The texture was melt in your mouth and the flavours were so nice.
en-unannotated-02496	I want to go back here again very soon!
en-unannotated-02497	Its cool name is accentuated by the innovative jellyfish lights complete with trailing tentacles bobbing in the bar area.
en-unannotated-02498	The food are excellent and very tasteful.
en-unannotated-02499	Price very reasonable for the quality.
en-unannotated-02500	All of the staff were very friendly and the room was always kept clean and tidy.
en-unannotated-02501	A friend recommended Algarabia to me and I as so happy that I took her advice.
en-unannotated-02502	It's a great spot and pretty big, actually.
en-unannotated-02503	Me & doggie stayed 1 night en-route from Portugal to UK & exhausted yet made to feel so welcome.
en-unannotated-02504	A very upmarket place with prices and quality to match.
en-unannotated-02505	Although we payed around $400 per night we had a very old dim room lacking the basics of a comfortable stay.
en-unannotated-02506	Le Temps De Cerises is tempting and if you know what's good for you then you're going to give in to all your deepest, darkest desires and come for one of the most indulgent meals in Paris.
en-unannotated-02507	My and my colleagues went there for business for 2-3 days.
en-unannotated-02508	The staff were friendly and efficient on arrival offering tips, advice and a small map of San Sebastián.
en-unannotated-02509	Safe, clean, good food, and the service is superb.
en-unannotated-02510	The food was very unique and creative.
en-unannotated-02511	There are not a lot of places to eat in this area and we walked past this one at first.
en-unannotated-02512	The skin was excellently crisp, and the fat was perfectly rendered.
en-unannotated-02513	Best culinary experience in Europe.
en-unannotated-02514	This was perhaps a mistake since inevitably, some street noise filters in.
en-unannotated-02515	Overall the experience was good and the wait was worth it for this restaurant.
en-unannotated-02516	Reasonable price.
en-unannotated-02517	Here you can enjoy fresh pastry and coffee.
en-unannotated-02518	As you walk into this tiny little joint there is maybe 2 handfuls of fine meats in the open display, only outnumbered by the number of butchers and cooks cramped into this tiny little kitchen.
en-unannotated-02519	I'm not sure if that's how it should be for this dish.
en-unannotated-02520	Service staff very pleasant!
en-unannotated-02521	I still left a tip, but did not feel good about it.
en-unannotated-02522	I have to disagree as the menu price did NOT match the food quality.
en-unannotated-02523	Loved the comped breakfast and workout room.
en-unannotated-02524	My boyfriend liked his dish, but he said it wasn't the best pasta he had in Italy.
en-unannotated-02525	Usually, museum restaurants are average, but the food here is stellar.
en-unannotated-02526	They were all yummy and good value.
en-unannotated-02527	A series of thin hanging spotlights light each individual table.
en-unannotated-02528	Ricardo Lopez and team at the restaurant made sure never to disappoint .
en-unannotated-02529	Oh my god.
en-unannotated-02530	The interior is contemporary but warm.
en-unannotated-02531	The chef is a true artist and ensures your evening will be...
en-unannotated-02532	We enjoyed our stay, and we'll definitely come back.
en-unannotated-02533	The second bathroom is difficult to use and the fan needs fixing.
en-unannotated-02534	It was surprising to know that most of the fine dining restaurants in Paris are closed in weekend.
en-unannotated-02535	The pasta itself, handmade every day, was also perfect.
en-unannotated-02536	Mine was absolutely incredible, came stuffed to the brim and topped with a rich and creamy sauce.
en-unannotated-02537	The rest of the lobby was oddly segmented into different rooms.
en-unannotated-02538	Omg scrumptious!
en-unannotated-02539	To start, we had the Foie Gras special (which was a little adventurous for me), but delicious nonetheless - it melts in your mouth!
en-unannotated-02540	Not too fancy, but lovely white tablecloths and warm service from the all-male staff.
en-unannotated-02541	Make a reservation for 9? No one is sitting at that table at 8. Service is excellent, as is [NAME]'s English, and to food is better.
en-unannotated-02542	Highly recommend this place, I went at around 8:30PM and the place wasn't crowded at all!
en-unannotated-02543	The beef was awfully dry.
en-unannotated-02544	Paula, Mafe and the other ladies of the executive floors are a real treat and provide warm greetings at breakfasts every morning.
en-unannotated-02545	Reasonable price - $15. They had a &3.50 cover charge...
en-unannotated-02546	Excellent food and wine pairing, attentive staff with moderate anglais proficiency, wonderful experience.
en-unannotated-02547	It is located just opposite to the La Bretxa and so is frequented by the local people.
en-unannotated-02548	Great food, friendly service.
en-unannotated-02549	Tiny but deadly!
en-unannotated-02550	Update: over two week trip, we ate here five times, and were never disappointed.
en-unannotated-02551	It delivered on all its promises.
en-unannotated-02552	Great place to stay, near nice park to have good run, eat well, go to mass while on business trip.
en-unannotated-02553	Complicated stuff.
en-unannotated-02554	Great quality but a little on the pricey side.
en-unannotated-02555	Clean rooms for an incredible price.
en-unannotated-02556	I'd say at least stop in to try some traditional style beer that reaches beyond the typical pilsner.
en-unannotated-02557	The reception staff were very helpful.
en-unannotated-02558	Not only was this my best and favorite meal in Prague, it was my favorite in my whole trip through several countries and one of my favorite meals I can remember recently anywhere.
en-unannotated-02559	Service was impeccable and very friendly.
en-unannotated-02560	The pastry/ cake shop is near the Town Hall & just outside the Old Town.
en-unannotated-02561	Great place, great service, great food-creative and tasty, reasonably priced for what it is, wonderful atmosphere!
en-unannotated-02562	Luckly we were able to get last two...
en-unannotated-02563	- Noisy pipes/electric system;
en-unannotated-02564	His suggestions on the TWO nights we ate there (at outside tables).
en-unannotated-02565	We were looking for a good price good location hotel and nothing fancy.
en-unannotated-02566	Smiles and clinking of glasses all around .
en-unannotated-02567	Another attractive feature for international travelers.
en-unannotated-02568	only one lamp and plug socket worked  my partner spent the evening changing light bulbs around.
en-unannotated-02569	Beautiful venue - at first feels very enchanting but after some time feels a bit "over the top" - nonetheless a beautifully done up venue.
en-unannotated-02570	We had the sea food plate for two people for 45€. It was so good.
en-unannotated-02571	It's often hard to find a "cool" cafe/bar where the staff are actually friendly, but Brew's crew come through with the goods in this respect.
en-unannotated-02572	Then got sent to the bar - which is fine.
en-unannotated-02573	Had a few pieces of popcorn which didn't add to the dish.
en-unannotated-02574	The food was tasty and came out fast.
en-unannotated-02575	Cannot recommend this place enough.
en-unannotated-02576	The new app couldn't find my Home address.
en-unannotated-02577	Received the same room (preferred) and requests (lower, corner floor w/ extra pillows) are always honoured.
en-unannotated-02578	still looking for that "wow" moment.
en-unannotated-02579	I don't know if I would recommend it.
en-unannotated-02580	This is one of the better Japanese places near the CBD and when you enter you are greeted with a hearty "Irasshaimase" meaning ''Welcome" from the chefs behind the bar.
en-unannotated-02581	The location was excellent and the view of the palace was Brilliant.
en-unannotated-02582	Had the bacon and cabbage and it was fantastic.
en-unannotated-02583	The pink champagne beautiful and we even managed to share a desert.
en-unannotated-02584	Don't bother even trying.
en-unannotated-02585	$$
en-unannotated-02586	We had a connecting family room for four people.
en-unannotated-02587	When you enter, one of the first things that you will notice is that there are different areas: the bar area at the entrance, and then a LOOOOONG dining area beyond the bar.
en-unannotated-02588	[5/5] Outstanding.
en-unannotated-02589	The menu is clearly marked for those who are searching for gluten free, which I am one.
en-unannotated-02590	I didn't even know I liked meatloaf 'till I had that.
en-unannotated-02591	We had French onion soup and escargot and our mains veal and the duck with banana.
en-unannotated-02592	Best italian restaurant we've ever visited!
en-unannotated-02593	This little bar/ restaurant is such a nice place!
en-unannotated-02594	Nice big plate.
en-unannotated-02595	We stay often in Hilton Garden Inns because they are always clean and the staff friendly.
en-unannotated-02596	Beautiful looking place.
en-unannotated-02597	Also, they accept credit cards.
en-unannotated-02598	My hotel recommended this restaurant two months ago.
en-unannotated-02599	If I would've more time would eat here again.
en-unannotated-02600	The place is super cute and off the busy streets so it's a nice quiet place for breakfast
en-unannotated-02601	Sides and bread were included.
en-unannotated-02602	The vibe is really easy going if a little bit hipster.
en-unannotated-02603	I normally am not a cocktail gal but when we initially stopped in here during my usual Birthday bar hop (first one in Australia), I tried the Jam Drop in a martini glass.
en-unannotated-02604	In fact, any "warm pintxos" (done at the moment you order them) will work!
en-unannotated-02605	The whole evening was a taste sensation and we loved being able to watch the...
en-unannotated-02606	was the elevators became super slow, due to large volume of customers at this hotel.
en-unannotated-02607	Helpful staff, too!
en-unannotated-02608	Because I really liked to stream content from my mobile(used as hotspot). Can you please let me know if there is any setting to get back that option.
en-unannotated-02609	This was the only thing I die in this message in error, and a half hour to go to bed at a later time.
en-unannotated-02610	Centrally Located in Madrid.
en-unannotated-02611	We enjoyed the location of this resort near everything that we wanted to see.
en-unannotated-02612	[name] and [name] were very friendly and made us felt at home.
en-unannotated-02613	Husband and wife run the restaurant (he cooks, she serves), seating is extremely limited (parties of more than 3 won't get seated), almost no English is spoken, free food and drinks flow nonstop over the course...
en-unannotated-02614	Absolute rubbish since it took over from hailo.
en-unannotated-02615	Supreme room was a good room choice for a family.
en-unannotated-02616	Also if you get a text during rally,game doesn't pause and you will be at risk of a loss.
en-unannotated-02617	We came here on the last day when we were in Ireland and although we got the worst seats in house, we were happy with the service and food.
en-unannotated-02618	Casa Gonzalez was a great choice as a base to explore the teeming bustling Mexico City with its endless offerings and most impoetantly as a solo female traveller i felt very safe at all times.
en-unannotated-02619	We came back for more beers on our last day!
en-unannotated-02620	Both were great, special and worth every Koruna.
en-unannotated-02621	Safe deposit set too high to be reached.
en-unannotated-02622	The wifi connection in our room was unreliable and the TV did not receive some of the advertised channels, particularly the  BBC and the French news channel.
en-unannotated-02623	Not many places serve typical Colombian cuisine like this hotel does.
en-unannotated-02624	Location is the best you can get!
en-unannotated-02625	I would definitely stay thee again in the future.
en-unannotated-02626	INCREDIBLE pasta dishes!
en-unannotated-02627	You will not be disappointed!
en-unannotated-02628	For the service, if nothing else (another surprise!).
en-unannotated-02629	Chef [NAME] is too cute!
en-unannotated-02630	This is a butcher shop so I guess I shouldn't have expected it to be a sit down type of place.
en-unannotated-02631	Ambience is amazing.
en-unannotated-02632	The rooms are comfortable and well equipped and although a little dated in decor, extremely well kept and clean.
en-unannotated-02633	But it still sucks when it happens to you...
en-unannotated-02634	I had the Escalope de veau normande, I would post a picture but others have beat me to the punch!
en-unannotated-02635	You can literally spoon this sauce into your mouth because it's that good.
en-unannotated-02636	Deliciously uncomplicated place serving just mussels and calamari, mastered to perfection.
en-unannotated-02637	Ordered two cakes for a birthday party dulce de leché and Guinness.
en-unannotated-02638	Great central location near a lot of restaurants and sites.
en-unannotated-02639	Service is offensively slow, to the point that you wait and you can see that nobody is making your food for over 20min.
en-unannotated-02640	Highly recommend.
en-unannotated-02641	Each course was a treat to the senses.
en-unannotated-02642	Served with a rich, creamy bernaise.
en-unannotated-02643	And Everything was perfetto: the risotto, the 7 the veal and amazing tiramisu.
en-unannotated-02644	Not heavily spiced.
en-unannotated-02645	The carbonara tasted okay and maybe average for American standards.
en-unannotated-02646	WHAT TO TRY?
en-unannotated-02647	I was expecting a little bit of meat and lettuce on a plate, however this was something much more substantial and impressive.
en-unannotated-02648	Great location with a small reception area and great and helpful staff.
en-unannotated-02649	Damaged bed.
en-unannotated-02650	Make sure to check this out...
en-unannotated-02651	and one of my new favourite spots in Dublin.
en-unannotated-02652	I heard that its open...
en-unannotated-02653	My only complaint would be that the beef was a bit drier than I like.
en-unannotated-02654	Very overrated.
en-unannotated-02655	Keep up the good work
en-unannotated-02656	An unexpectedly delicious lunch within the Guinness storehouse!
en-unannotated-02657	The food was very good, especially the breakfast which was excellent.
en-unannotated-02658	I might go back sometime as there are so many great reviews here.
en-unannotated-02659	The fries were typical Belgian style (thicker, more potato taste), and they also have sweet potato fries.
en-unannotated-02660	Three dishes to be exact (see photos). The food was great and so was the service.
en-unannotated-02661	You should know that there are actually two Tinto Y Tapas, the second and newer one located only 100 mores around the corner from the smaller original restaurant.
en-unannotated-02662	Please I would like you to solve these bugs.
en-unannotated-02663	Ordered the schnitzel, pork belly, potato dumplings and the chicken soup.
en-unannotated-02664	We were in Paris to celebrate a vegetarian friend's BIG birthday & found Loly's Supper Club via Trip Advisor.
en-unannotated-02665	They made several personal adjustments with no issues.
en-unannotated-02666	And here You can...
en-unannotated-02667	The fish soup was very good, extremely...
en-unannotated-02668	Maso, maso and maso.
en-unannotated-02669	The room was not functional.
en-unannotated-02670	the staff,
en-unannotated-02671	The food was good but no "wow" factor.
en-unannotated-02672	I can't even use the app!
en-unannotated-02673	I highly recommend coming here
en-unannotated-02674	The annoying part is that ill look at the story again and again and again.
en-unannotated-02675	Seven Seeds as house, with a rotating roster of local roasters (try saying THAT three times fast) as guest coffees.
en-unannotated-02676	We came for an early lunch and loved every bite.
en-unannotated-02677	We ordered:
en-unannotated-02678	Truly an amazing dish worth every penny.
en-unannotated-02679	Escargot: Tasty...
en-unannotated-02680	However!
en-unannotated-02681	Fix it.
en-unannotated-02682	For starters, I've learned that the specials are usually the way to go and ordered the mozzarella and tomato appetizer and a plate of charcuterie.
en-unannotated-02683	Delicious!
en-unannotated-02684	The service.
en-unannotated-02685	The dishes are explicit, the decor is classical and the service its exceptional, it's not noise!
en-unannotated-02686	Our party of 8, including 2 young kids, showed up for dinner last Friday at a little after 8pm without a reservation, thinking it was early so we didn't need one.
en-unannotated-02687	Friendly staff and a decent selection of beer and wine
en-unannotated-02688	5. Cocao sorbet with caramel, chocolate crunch, chocolate wafer.
en-unannotated-02689	Wow what a meal.
en-unannotated-02690	We were there for a wedding, the hotel handled all the many guests beautifully.
en-unannotated-02691	Each burger is about $13-15 and they are monstrous so I think you definitely get your money's worth!
en-unannotated-02692	With tender meat, bags of flavour and uber smooth mash it was a winner from the get go.
en-unannotated-02693	Great location and quality of service.
en-unannotated-02694	Small, charming restaurant where you can smell the open kitchen that the chef is listening to, the welcome from the waitress very warm.
en-unannotated-02695	Heavenly!
en-unannotated-02696	I was on the 3rd floor in room 302, which unfortunately looks out the back of the hotel.
en-unannotated-02697	Room was not as shown on line.
en-unannotated-02698	BEST.
en-unannotated-02699	Creme brulee - amazing
en-unannotated-02700	) Soup are really good and coconut cake too!
en-unannotated-02701	I got the bacon, banana, and maple syrup pancakes for 135 crowns.
en-unannotated-02702	Their other plates might be good, but I've had a lot of pozole in Mexico City, and this...
en-unannotated-02703	Will try out the other recommended dish the knee knob next time!
en-unannotated-02704	Beds are probably older than Roman Empire and you can actually hear the people from the room next room!
en-unannotated-02705	The tuna was pure and beautifully marinated.
en-unannotated-02706	Simply pick raw piece of meat and let your butcher and his friends prepare fantastic meal for you.
en-unannotated-02707	I went there at exact 6pm, they just opened the door and soon it was full of people standing for food.
en-unannotated-02708	So fresh.
en-unannotated-02709	Very relaxing and beautiful.
en-unannotated-02710	They didn't empty the rubbish bins.
en-unannotated-02711	We took the short menu For €53. It's basically a tasting menu that includes five appetizers , one Main and two desserts.
en-unannotated-02712	The food was amazing- all of it.
en-unannotated-02713	A true game of skill A few things I would change is making the "spin the wheel" game available everyday not with a 24 hour countdown to play!
en-unannotated-02714	Pivovar U Tří Růží is right off of Old Town but is still authentic and affordable.
en-unannotated-02715	Seriously?
en-unannotated-02716	Hamburger.
en-unannotated-02717	You can order this gourmet salad as an entree or split as an appetizer but definitely the BEST duck salad I've had in MY LIFE!
en-unannotated-02718	Jean is an amazingly talented chef and took such exquisite care of us.
en-unannotated-02719	I have been wanting to visit this place since my introduction to it last year.
en-unannotated-02720	Everytime i open it it just shuts down completely.
en-unannotated-02721	We took their daily recommendation, a pepper steak.
en-unannotated-02722	Also, the restaurant is kind of "fancy". It doesn't have a casual vibe, FYI.
en-unannotated-02723	As I write this review my husband is going to pick up more for us and our entire group traveling with us.
en-unannotated-02724	The meal we had was one we won't forget and I'd definitely recommend trying Rudi's imaginative menu.
en-unannotated-02725	Stopped by here for some after dinner tea/coffee and desert.
en-unannotated-02726	Even though it was older style accomodation it had everything we needed.
en-unannotated-02727	Little noisy
en-unannotated-02728	The Risotto and scallops were EXCELLENT too.
en-unannotated-02729	The chocolate is very good but not amazing.
en-unannotated-02730	Made us smile on a rainy day.
en-unannotated-02731	I often find you get 3 or 4 in this type of dish but they had mountains of them in this one, really flavoursome and just the right level of kick.
en-unannotated-02732	This is one of my best experience in Prague along with all the amazing site-seeing.
en-unannotated-02733	Can't wait to try brunch.
en-unannotated-02734	Stopped here for a good night sleep on our way driving from Madrid, Spain to Lourdes, France.
en-unannotated-02735	And the scallops?
en-unannotated-02736	Sooo good!
en-unannotated-02737	Great location for walking distance attractions, the hotel is in front of a park that at night during the weekend has food, clothing, music, souvenirs.
en-unannotated-02738	Outstanding location and ambiance...
en-unannotated-02739	Room was a nice size, very clean and large bathroom.
en-unannotated-02740	Service was excellent, out waitress was personable and pleasant.
en-unannotated-02741	Some issues with the hotel were...
en-unannotated-02742	I've lost millions of coins because the game crashes.
en-unannotated-02743	All neatly wrapped and perfectly cooked to medium rare.
en-unannotated-02744	Come to think of it, so is the dessert.
en-unannotated-02745	Pouring down property ...
en-unannotated-02746	She explained, it's not really a place that a lot of tourists patronize, but...
en-unannotated-02747	If i could give this review 0 stars i would.
en-unannotated-02748	So delicious!
en-unannotated-02749	Amazing meal!
en-unannotated-02750	Husband got the duck with mashed potatoes and it was yummy.
en-unannotated-02751	The waiters were very kind and spoke a good amount of English.
en-unannotated-02752	Don't forget to pick up the little card that lets you collect stamps.
en-unannotated-02753	Excellent conversation and host
en-unannotated-02754	What a cool little place!
en-unannotated-02755	Either way, wonderful app!
en-unannotated-02756	This restaurant is a must in Milan.
en-unannotated-02757	App freezes up sometimes and doesn't show all of my emails.
en-unannotated-02758	I fall sick during my visit, the way bell boy Antonio interacted between the doctor and me in Spanish and English was commendable.
en-unannotated-02759	This is a comfortable modern hotel located at the edge of the swanky Salamanca district but within walking distance of the centre of the city.
en-unannotated-02760	I was tire and just wanted a shower.
en-unannotated-02761	Salmon, then duck croquet, then Gnocchi, then veal, then dessert.
en-unannotated-02762	They have really good fresh beer that they made by themselves too.
en-unannotated-02763	Sorted out parking for us no problem.
en-unannotated-02764	Came here because it was the most reviewed place on Yelp in Prague!
en-unannotated-02765	I don't know if this was just today or if they never have any.
en-unannotated-02766	The staff and our room was welcoming.
en-unannotated-02767	The pork loin, however, was nothing special and if I were to dine here again, I would probably try out the fish of the day because that dish seemed really delicious and popular.
en-unannotated-02768	I love this game very this is an incredible  game i have ever played since i really don't  know.
en-unannotated-02769	Very tasty with bread.
en-unannotated-02770	They were just about to close for a midday break but the host graciously let us in.
en-unannotated-02771	We ordered off the early dinner menu.
en-unannotated-02772	Nice!
en-unannotated-02773	We were keen to find a hotel experience distinct to our destination, something that's not a luxury chain but is still highly-refined and conscientiously-designed, and La Valise exceeded our expectations, which were pretty high already given the reviews here.
en-unannotated-02774	Its very dark in here but not in a Dracula's living room sort of way.
en-unannotated-02775	Gym facilities were well equipped but needed an area for floor stretching.
en-unannotated-02776	this overlooked the main floor of the restaurant.
en-unannotated-02777	Staff was super friendly and service minded.
en-unannotated-02778	And not expensive as most of the...
en-unannotated-02779	Everyone around us...
en-unannotated-02780	It was just the right amount of tangy and combined with the sourness of the cream and the sweet crunchy candied pecans, the whole dish was phenomenal.
en-unannotated-02781	A lot cheaper than Uber Black since that's all they have out here.
en-unannotated-02782	The duck was good though, it was juicy and slightly sweet with the sauce.
en-unannotated-02783	[NAME] was walking out as I walked in - caught me off guard.
en-unannotated-02784	Неплохая кухня с любимыми варениками! На любой вкус и цвет! Сладкоежкам рекомендую шоколадные вареники с вишней с липовым чаем!
en-unannotated-02785	We ordered our breakfast and coffees only to realise we had left our money back at our hotel.
en-unannotated-02786	I have traveled all of my life and eaten in some of the finest restaurants in the world.
en-unannotated-02787	It was by far the best most authentic place we visited in Paris.
en-unannotated-02788	location excellent in walking distance of all attractions
en-unannotated-02789	Much better than others that were highly recommended.
en-unannotated-02790	It looks like a seventeenth century baroque palace.
en-unannotated-02791	We had a delicious meal in a lovely outdoor courtyard under a grape arbor.
en-unannotated-02792	Sitting outside you have a great view of the square which is much more atmospheric than the larger square lower in the town.
en-unannotated-02793	And you have to try...
en-unannotated-02794	Steaks cooked to your order and excellent choices for accompanying dishes.
en-unannotated-02795	We tried a few flavours during our stay and they were all outstanding.
en-unannotated-02796	Definitely one of my favourite places to dine in the city.
en-unannotated-02797	Eloy in, incorrect password, will end new email.
en-unannotated-02798	I was certainly the one who spoke the least Italian.
en-unannotated-02799	I decided to give tinder a try only to have my phone freeze upon downloading, needing a hard reboot.
en-unannotated-02800	I really loved the open kitchen format, this is how a chef should truly create.
en-unannotated-02801	I need this app so much to record my voice and then upload it immediately on my SC account.
en-unannotated-02802	We went all out on the food, and got the "Trio of Irish Spring Lamb.
en-unannotated-02803	Everything is gluten free and I honestly couldn't tell.
en-unannotated-02804	We called on our way to make a reservation which is really needed in order to get a table.
en-unannotated-02805	The only change I would make is have a full glass of wine with the two main dishes and charge a tad more.
en-unannotated-02806	Yesss.
en-unannotated-02807	You tell them how many...
en-unannotated-02808	Great service!
en-unannotated-02809	Perfect service.
en-unannotated-02810	The waitress that served us was also really nice and spoke english.
en-unannotated-02811	Edit: the manager (?) approached me about my above review as we were getting ready to leave.
en-unannotated-02812	We chose not to order lunch.
en-unannotated-02813	They also have a refrigerator of drinks to choose from, I got a blood orange and a passion fruit drink, both lightly carbonated and delicious!
en-unannotated-02814	although the room itself was well appointed, ours was on the ground floor and virtually windowless.
en-unannotated-02815	I'm only sad it's such a long plane ride away from me.
en-unannotated-02816	It a cool mix with the performance
en-unannotated-02817	However, the side pasta with sauce was somewhat underwhelming.
en-unannotated-02818	Corsican mussels...
en-unannotated-02819	The 2 guest services hotel staff ( Ariadna and Paula) were extremely knowledgeable and helpful and enhanced our stay at the hotel and Madrid.
en-unannotated-02820	The staff are great.
en-unannotated-02821	However, they proceeded to charge us €2.5 per person for this unsolicited dish, and had it not been so tasty, I would've been pretty annoyed.
en-unannotated-02822	Just Amazing.
en-unannotated-02823	It's huge by Prague standards.
en-unannotated-02824	Nice comfort food and great service.
en-unannotated-02825	Horrible experience, asked to be seated at the bar because their restaurant was "full". Sat for half an hour with no drink service.
en-unannotated-02826	Huge portion and all delicious and the vibe was just right-- there is French and loud Americans and proper Brits.
en-unannotated-02827	If ever I go Paris again, would sure to visit this restaurant again, as my experience dining here really unforgettable.
en-unannotated-02828	I checked yelp and discovered that this restaurant was still open and it had decent reviews so I decided to give it a try.
en-unannotated-02829	There are ads, but I just hit the "back button" and move along.
en-unannotated-02830	If you are looking for a quick cheap bite, you can go here.
en-unannotated-02831	You could tell that this restaurant was wholesome, homemade, and all around fantastic!
en-unannotated-02832	Great food, atmosphere and staff.
en-unannotated-02833	No extra heater and every two hours heater would turn on which isn't enough.
en-unannotated-02834	Very good food and God service.
en-unannotated-02835	We found this place on yelp as we were around the neighborhood looking for a place to grab dinner.
en-unannotated-02836	It is hard to get table outside the same day.
en-unannotated-02837	Great food, excellent service and nice wine list.
en-unannotated-02838	Housekeeping was terrific.
en-unannotated-02839	Incredible staff who are attentive and will guide you to the best places.
en-unannotated-02840	The robata veg were good.
en-unannotated-02841	This is quite a posh (but non-snobby) dining establishment which offers varying seafood options.
en-unannotated-02842	The Oscar is lively character....
en-unannotated-02843	It can be a bit tricky to find, just head inside and down the stairs.
en-unannotated-02844	It was still good!
en-unannotated-02845	;)
en-unannotated-02846	Also should be able to repeat a single song or the entire playlist.
en-unannotated-02847	The hotel have amazing rooms, moderns with excellent design.
en-unannotated-02848	I've never (until eating here) felt rushed at a restaurant in Europe.
en-unannotated-02849	We both indulged in Hillbilly Ciders which are crisp flavoured and not too dry not too sweet.
en-unannotated-02850	We really enjoyed our stay and is a great value.
en-unannotated-02851	The place was spacious and clean, since you're supposed to clean your own table and bring the trays...
en-unannotated-02852	Lately even in Germany's when you order schnitzel it's either pork or chicken this was veal.
en-unannotated-02853	I ordered the Beef and Guinness Stew.
en-unannotated-02854	Whole meal came out to 705 CZK which is about 26€. Great great food for good prices!
en-unannotated-02855	Everything was perfection...
en-unannotated-02856	I highly recommend this place!
en-unannotated-02857	I wish I could replicate this joint in NYC.
en-unannotated-02858	Love the place.
en-unannotated-02859	Nice building
en-unannotated-02860	Super friendly and let us sample a few of the different stouts.
en-unannotated-02861	Great hotel, close to everything in Mexico City.
en-unannotated-02862	available parking zone.
en-unannotated-02863	Close to the centre and on our way back to the ship called in for a cold local beer and coffees - refreshing and welcomed
en-unannotated-02864	And I heard the lady say to them: "I'm sorry" and one guy just said "It's ok". Still no idea how the food tastes after 30-40 min cause I haven't gotten to it.
en-unannotated-02865	Bought over 6 things on this including my car.
en-unannotated-02866	I would recommend anyone who is in Milan to head here for a meal.
en-unannotated-02867	Beds firm.
en-unannotated-02868	What a delicious drop it was.
en-unannotated-02869	I can say that all staff are great from receptionist, bell man (Ivan) and (Jose Alberto), to the waiters in breakfast to hotel manager are super helpful and attentive since the moment we arrived at the hotel in reception.
en-unannotated-02870	Make sure you save some bread (or order another basket) to drench in the sauce!
en-unannotated-02871	None of the programme playing not happy with it at all .
en-unannotated-02872	Be aware that this place will be packed during the evenings with locals and tourists alike, but if you can get a table, it's well worth a stay.
en-unannotated-02873	They had buttons on the table for asking for service.
en-unannotated-02874	Or sourced from Eastern Europe?
en-unannotated-02875	We also had the escargot but I wouldn't say the highlight of this restaurant is the escargot.
en-unannotated-02876	Old bank building largely kept it's interior but transformed into a cool bar with variety if drinks including fancy cocktails and craft beers.
en-unannotated-02877	The restaurant is very small.
en-unannotated-02878	We were not told that we would be one of the few not planning with the soccer club!!
en-unannotated-02879	Very deserving of the 5 star rating.
en-unannotated-02880	Without reservation, or anything, but they have treated me great.
en-unannotated-02881	Also with a great view.
en-unannotated-02882	Something else is I think it would be more fun if there was a leader board or something with everyone's scores on.
en-unannotated-02883	We meet new people thanks to a good atmosphere and thanks to a very nice boss !
en-unannotated-02884	I can't rate it highly enough.
en-unannotated-02885	App is pretty much useless.
en-unannotated-02886	Location is the key.
en-unannotated-02887	The place was not extremely busy - the fact we really appreciate
en-unannotated-02888	Just great from start to finish
en-unannotated-02889	I ordered from the "Specialities of Lokal" section...
en-unannotated-02890	different types of bread still or sparkling...
en-unannotated-02891	Very professional service from staff.
en-unannotated-02892	when it felt like working !!
en-unannotated-02893	Everyone is automatically served an appetizer before the meal.
en-unannotated-02894	an omelette is not always an omelette.
en-unannotated-02895	Omg why did I share!?
en-unannotated-02896	The patatas with roquefort were also delicious.
en-unannotated-02897	Basic restaurant with delicious traditional food, huge portions in a central location, price good for this area.
en-unannotated-02898	A 4 star experience but one lost due to pricing.
en-unannotated-02899	It is very modern and has a cool, urban vibe to it.
en-unannotated-02900	The atmosphere here is cute and cosy and we LOVE that it us BYOW.
en-unannotated-02901	Service was quick and there was nice friendly atmosphere.
en-unannotated-02902	The restaurant is perfectly situated with a view of the Storey Bridge.
en-unannotated-02903	The room was large but uncomfortable.
en-unannotated-02904	I can put away alot of food but could not finish this one.
en-unannotated-02905	Waitstaff was very attentive and polite.
en-unannotated-02906	A lady explained us patiently which allergens which ice-cream contained.
en-unannotated-02907	And within walking distance from the Gare de Lyon, which can come in handy.
en-unannotated-02908	They promptly and graciously responded to each request.
en-unannotated-02909	Portions are large , servers run around a lot in a hurry so I felt rushed.
en-unannotated-02910	The rooms were not like the pictures on booking at all.
en-unannotated-02911	Everything is new and the staff is helpful.
en-unannotated-02912	That is shocking and the first time it has ever happened in all my dining experiences.
en-unannotated-02913	We felt as though the courses were rushed as we usually didn't finish our wine from the previous course before being presented with a...
en-unannotated-02914	The menu is short but offers enough variety to satisfy anyone.
en-unannotated-02915	Well-located in the city, while on a quiet street.
en-unannotated-02916	To make your experience more ask to be sitting downstairs.
en-unannotated-02917	The meal was so cheap!
en-unannotated-02918	We're fans, but novices.
en-unannotated-02919	Perfect location for walking to all the sights, or to catch the metro if your feet are tired.
en-unannotated-02920	From the room to the menu to the wine list, to the service to the food, this is a restaurant at the very top of...
en-unannotated-02921	We ordered two bottles of wine (Cliele red wine must try). Everyone ended up paying around 25 USD for everything, which is honestly a steal for such authentic food, great wine, and friendly service.
en-unannotated-02922	L'Altru Versu burned down Saturday night, June 28th, and so shouldn't be included in your vacation plans - at least for now!!
en-unannotated-02923	Always reliable
en-unannotated-02924	There are also some stalls you can retire into if you would like some more privacy and there's a vintage videogame over by the bar if you would like to kick some street fighter ass :-) Board games are also available if you are into that stuff.
en-unannotated-02925	This is for fine Lunch or Dinner,
en-unannotated-02926	No fresh juice, no fresh bread.
en-unannotated-02927	Service was polite and efficient.
en-unannotated-02928	Takes the fun outta the game.
en-unannotated-02929	The breakfast, we had the avacado and egg,...
en-unannotated-02930	Note to travelers, they have a few vegetarian options on the menu.
en-unannotated-02931	Also the Seafood pie was very good...
en-unannotated-02932	The plating was true art.
en-unannotated-02933	The bar staff definitely deserve a shout out for being friendly, and awesome enough to give their cocktails funny names.
en-unannotated-02934	More studential place with wifi and place to sit with your laptop but also good for relaxation with a nice selection of cakes...
en-unannotated-02935	Even better, people weren't crammed in like you might find at other places--it was clearly full (we sat at the bar because there would have been a wait for a table), but bustling in a pleasant way, rather than making customers feel cramped.
en-unannotated-02936	You can choose from full cream, low fat, or soy variations.
en-unannotated-02937	It's a beautiful venue and the bar staff are all so knowledgable and friendly.
en-unannotated-02938	Location
en-unannotated-02939	The lobby is small and doesn't look great but service is good.
en-unannotated-02940	Had the beef tartar and the dry aged hamburger with cheese.
en-unannotated-02941	Moist, flavorful, intensely wonderful!
en-unannotated-02942	the delicate flavour of the cuttlefish and artichoke worked so well and the dish was perfectly seasoned.
en-unannotated-02943	Bed was  uncomfortable and the metal frame was old and noisy.
en-unannotated-02944	We were a group of 20+ people and had a great dinner.
en-unannotated-02945	As well as great coffee they serve a variety of hot chocolates and tea and a selection of bottled iced coffees and iced chocolates.
en-unannotated-02946	We can’t imagine staying anywhere else when we visit Madrid.
en-unannotated-02947	The garlic bread was delicious however the mains whilst generous, lacked some depth of flavour and not as cheap as i'd hoped.
en-unannotated-02948	Although I had my fair share of heavy, savory meals in Paris this was one of the most distinctive in flavor, and that's in part because of how much butter the food is made with.
en-unannotated-02949	It's a sit down restaurant, so reasonable price.
en-unannotated-02950	It's situated in a quiet street of Usaquén and thus it's easy to find fantastic restaurants in walking distance.
en-unannotated-02951	But the burgers were great.
en-unannotated-02952	The food n the restaurant can be improved as five star.
en-unannotated-02953	From splitting the pizzas for us to bringing us a large plate of free cookies at the end of our meal, we felt very welcomed since walking in.
en-unannotated-02954	First, the location is great.
en-unannotated-02955	They make these incredible little pastries that I haven't seen anywhere else in the world.
en-unannotated-02956	Thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish!
en-unannotated-02957	But if I were to come again, I would get the chocolate dessert because cooked apples just ain't my thang.
en-unannotated-02958	Food was fresh and tasty and exactly what I was hoping for when I walked into the place.
en-unannotated-02959	From antiques and old blenders and apperitivi posters to the bras and underwear hanged in the tender like grandma used to.
en-unannotated-02960	Room decor is bit on the 'sparse' side.
en-unannotated-02961	We had a great meal here - nice atmosphere, lovely staff and excellent food.
en-unannotated-02962	Let's start by: don't miss out the breakfast.
en-unannotated-02963	I'd fly back to Brisbane just for one sip of that drink again.
en-unannotated-02964	The waiter actually let me choose which table I wanted, which was nice.
en-unannotated-02965	2 twin beds pushed together to make a king
en-unannotated-02966	The food: 4/5. We had tried lunch and dinner there and enjoyed both.
en-unannotated-02967	Friendly welcoming environment and beautiful presentation of the courses, with awesome champagne.
en-unannotated-02968	Sooo good!
en-unannotated-02969	Would highly recommend
en-unannotated-02970	I can assure you that my meal was worth every cent; it's just not somewhere that I'll be going all the time so I'll be saving this spot for my special occasions.
en-unannotated-02971	The Hotel is located at the Sante Fe district of Mexico City, which is a more posh district in Mexico City, it is a bit far from the center of the city.
en-unannotated-02972	I was offered a phone charger when my phone charger was not working.
en-unannotated-02973	I opted for the escargot and the peppery steak, (After eating nothing but pork and paella in Spain for a week, I was craving a hunk of MEAT). We chose a fairly priced bottle of Côtes du Rhône that paired well with the food.
en-unannotated-02974	While in neighborhood 3 we stopped by to check out the shop.
en-unannotated-02975	I'd especially like to try their savory cakes.
en-unannotated-02976	Friendly waiter and quick delivery.
en-unannotated-02977	Really disappointed to be honest.
en-unannotated-02978	Our overall bill was 835 CK and with my tip, it came to a total of 900 CK.
en-unannotated-02979	Worth checking out..
en-unannotated-02980	In fact, I might even stretch it to say they made me the best burger I've ever eaten one night a couple of months ago.
en-unannotated-02981	Looked small but I was full and sleepy halfway through.
en-unannotated-02982	Starters of mackerel and crab were very good with the mackerel exceptional.
en-unannotated-02983	Authentic Czech food, great service, reasonable.
en-unannotated-02984	We paid for 2 main dishes and 2...
en-unannotated-02985	First bite, second bite and another bite...
en-unannotated-02986	Character and charm from this old grand hotel.
en-unannotated-02987	Despite the few tables, the waiting time could have been much shorter if people were allocated more efficiently.
en-unannotated-02988	I saw this place on our Tripadvisor nearby restaurants, while visiting Mexico City.
en-unannotated-02989	Did I forget to mention its the oldest pub in Dublin.
en-unannotated-02990	It is situated close to the centre of San Sebastien with garage accommodation, a very receptive and willing staff and carefully designed albeit small rooms.
en-unannotated-02991	Walking distance from shopping centers, restaurants, museums, metro system and the incredible Chapultepec Gardens, with its beautiful Castle, lake and zoo.
en-unannotated-02992	Went really well with the sun dried tomatoes.
en-unannotated-02993	For the main, I had duck with a cherry sauce and vegetables served from a cast iron pan.
en-unannotated-02994	When used actively, browsing searching and saving albums for offline, I need to force stop the app every 8 minutes.
en-unannotated-02995	It was a great decision, the hotel staff was friendly and very attentive all the time, rooms are updated and cozy, and breakfast buffet was good too.
en-unannotated-02996	The breakfast was excellent and front desk staff were friendly.
en-unannotated-02997	They were helpful, kind and consistently pleasant during our stay.
en-unannotated-02998	Don't hesitate go and experience it!!!
en-unannotated-02999	So intimate, amazing servers, and the chef was phenomenal!
en-unannotated-03000	Walking through the street deciding where I should eat, I stopped in front of Boxty's House and thought it was very cute.
en-unannotated-03001	Front office was very friendly, have to specially mention about Ms. [name] the waitress who served breakfast .
en-unannotated-03002	This restaurant is a real gem to be discovered in Ajaccio.
en-unannotated-03003	Not very modern but still good.
en-unannotated-03004	Walking around Dublin looking for a late lunch and found the Little Kitchen.
en-unannotated-03005	Beds extremely comfortable .
en-unannotated-03006	Typical Entree Prices c.
en-unannotated-03007	[3/5] This came out piping out hot with the top of the cheese a bit hardened from the heat.
en-unannotated-03008	Really enjoyed our meals.
en-unannotated-03009	If i do not open the app, i dont know do i have an email.
en-unannotated-03010	The main flaw of the place is service.
en-unannotated-03011	Strawberry tea and pancake are delicious.
en-unannotated-03012	I'd recommend this place.
en-unannotated-03013	That's my one critique.
en-unannotated-03014	quaint rooms, terrible wifi service for such an exclusive hotel.
en-unannotated-03015	Staff incredibly helpful and cheerful, breakfast just what was wanted.
en-unannotated-03016	The bathroom was large and very clean.
en-unannotated-03017	Awesome food for a great price.
en-unannotated-03018	Because my partner is coeliac we have to try every recommended gluten free establishment in the city we are in.
en-unannotated-03019	Service was attentive and the food was excellent, particularly the chocolate dessert.
en-unannotated-03020	There was a good choice of breakfast and it was interesting meeting different people over breakfast.
en-unannotated-03021	I also recommend the fresh mango juice and the omelette...
en-unannotated-03022	The 2 side dishes of gnocchi and pumpkin were both fairly ordinary and were not eaten.
en-unannotated-03023	Many levels seem redundant, only block positions r different.
en-unannotated-03024	Some of them were mediocre and others just awful.
en-unannotated-03025	Great setting next to the sea.
en-unannotated-03026	Those bread dumplings soaked with sauce...
en-unannotated-03027	Bar area with great chandeliers and apperol spritz.
en-unannotated-03028	Our standard king room was very large, comfortable, and tastefully appointed.
en-unannotated-03029	We really enjoyed each course and the wine and felt...
en-unannotated-03030	Good place for a drink with a friend or two.
en-unannotated-03031	Staff attitude ranged from total perfection to rudeness
en-unannotated-03032	For an entree, I ordered the schnitzel.
en-unannotated-03033	PLEASE FIX THE FREAKING APP!!!
en-unannotated-03034	There were lots of locals and I was one of the very few foreigners in there.
en-unannotated-03035	Reservations are recommended; I made ours on 30 mins notice.
en-unannotated-03036	Everything about this place was top notch.
en-unannotated-03037	The few tables that they do have are positioned so closely together that you can't help but feel like you're sharing in the experience with those sitting next to you.
en-unannotated-03038	I'd recommend making reservations if you can cause this place get busy!
en-unannotated-03039	The ravioli was very creamy and tasty.
en-unannotated-03040	The bread is incredible and the prices are good.
en-unannotated-03041	Maybe it is rated so highly because it is across the street from the Hyatt Regency Hotel.
en-unannotated-03042	They have a good selection of beer and a nice whiskey cocktail list too.
en-unannotated-03043	We made reservations, but was not necessarily needed on a Sunday night.
en-unannotated-03044	You can also order a la carte which I would do next time for more choices.
en-unannotated-03045	The food is amazing and is presented so beautifully.
en-unannotated-03046	How to play pool but its very easy to play in android  phone  the only thing trouble is connection  other wise addictive
en-unannotated-03047	It was like that moment in Ratatouille.
en-unannotated-03048	Front desk a little special, however this is Mexico City.
en-unannotated-03049	We'd mentioned during making our reservation that we had to be at QPAC by approx 7:45pm for a concert and a few times throughout our meal they stopped to remind us of the time.
en-unannotated-03050	Our room was great- I would call it "uptown space saver". It was very small but very well appointed and new.
en-unannotated-03051	Carpets in Corridor leading to the rooms are old and smelly .
en-unannotated-03052	I ADORE The Bank.
en-unannotated-03053	The hotel building is old but interestingly renovated with modern style.
en-unannotated-03054	There, I was not disappointed.
en-unannotated-03055	Great cool vibe.
en-unannotated-03056	I installed and reinstalled again.
en-unannotated-03057	Their baristas are knowledgable and their coffee is always smooth, always aromatic, and never acidic.
en-unannotated-03058	especially at odd hours late in the night /early morning
en-unannotated-03059	The best goulash I've had in a bread bowl yet.
en-unannotated-03060	Good price as reservation was made thru...
en-unannotated-03061	A small gem that you will not regret if you are in the neighbourhood.
en-unannotated-03062	Amazing pasta!
en-unannotated-03063	The staff from reception to domestic services were very attentive and friendly.
en-unannotated-03064	I'm not sure who was managing the restaurant but he was so nice!
en-unannotated-03065	This place is a one size fits all.
en-unannotated-03066	The food and the wine was more than excellent - it was a feast for the senses and Xavi who welcomed us had a wonderful charisma...
en-unannotated-03067	This was the best meal my friends and I had on our trip.
en-unannotated-03068	This restaurant is all about great food.
en-unannotated-03069	The service at breakfast was pretty bad, we arrived twenty minutes before the limit time and the staff was already cleaning every thing and showing signs of bad humour and unpolite behaviour, it was embarrassing.
en-unannotated-03070	Not only dinner but a real travel through continents...
en-unannotated-03071	First on all there was a line to get in and they are unorganized with getting people seated.
en-unannotated-03072	I came here with a very high expectation.
en-unannotated-03073	The dessert selection offered with the café gourmand was excellent.
en-unannotated-03074	Food 8/10 service 7/10 decor 7/10
en-unannotated-03075	Super nice and professional welcome.
en-unannotated-03076	The location and the front desk staff
en-unannotated-03077	Wait staff are stylish and friendly.
en-unannotated-03078	We were here visiting the beautiful city of bonifacio, and when hungry we smelt the perfumes coming from the kitchen on this place.
en-unannotated-03079	I play it in office hrs.
en-unannotated-03080	I highly recommend this restaurant, but I would suggest making a reservation because of it's location.
en-unannotated-03081	As a tourist, this definitely felt more like a local place, which was nice.
en-unannotated-03082	Cocktails for $15-20, worth it?
en-unannotated-03083	It was very well heated.
en-unannotated-03084	Excellent location
en-unannotated-03085	The young women on the desk were uniformly helpful, cheerful, competent, efficient and nothing was ever too much trouble.
en-unannotated-03086	But it was delicious.
en-unannotated-03087	Try the pickled cheese and Goulash, you won't regret it :)
en-unannotated-03088	The dry-aged hamburger takes a little time, about 15min, to prepare, but is so worth the wait.
en-unannotated-03089	The homemade bread they served was warm and delicious.
en-unannotated-03090	Service was good not great.
en-unannotated-03091	I recommend this is an experience.
en-unannotated-03092	But wait the food came and it did!
en-unannotated-03093	Ehrmaaagoooddd, if I lived in Prague, I'd be here everyday and any thought of ever going vegan would 100% go out of the window (I'm a meat eater with lots of vegetarian tendencies).
en-unannotated-03094	Love it
en-unannotated-03095	It is the best!!!
en-unannotated-03096	Prices are very fair for the quality of food, ranging from 5-15 on average.
en-unannotated-03097	Really loved this pub during our visit to Dublin.
en-unannotated-03098	Thanks.
en-unannotated-03099	Time and time again, I was told to visit Lokal while in Prague.
en-unannotated-03100	We were given homemade limoncello at the end of our meal and it was the best we had tasted throughout our entire trip.
en-unannotated-03101	Chateaubriand was excellent and their special Gin and Tonic with apple ice cubes is the best.
en-unannotated-03102	Best in town guys!
en-unannotated-03103	Short walk to the beach.
en-unannotated-03104	This was the bar we went to on our first night in San Sebastián - and what a start it was.
en-unannotated-03105	Love the app but ads are annoying!
en-unannotated-03106	( not even single crunch apple) and the breakfast area that moved from one room to another ;
en-unannotated-03107	I wouldn't go back.
en-unannotated-03108	Very modern and friendly.
en-unannotated-03109	Overall, this is a place I always recommend to any friends or families visiting!
en-unannotated-03110	I had lamb on preserved vegetables and mash, served with a sauce vierge.
en-unannotated-03111	So when asked to suggest a place for dinner with work colleagues on a Tuesday evening, including a visitor from the US, I tried to think of a place which would show off the best of Brisbane, wasn't too expensive but would still be a good meal and wasn't too far from the CBD.
en-unannotated-03112	The bartender was super duper friendly and thanked me when I gushed about how much I loved the blueberry beer.
en-unannotated-03113	We choose the Sonesta based on location, reviews, and a great price / value combination.
en-unannotated-03114	It's done it multiple times.
en-unannotated-03115	We travelled as a couple and stayed at this hotel from 20th to 24th April to attend a conference at centro Banamex (which was 10 to 15 min walk from hotel) Payment plan was to be on arrival.
en-unannotated-03116	Second stay,and its still briliiant.
en-unannotated-03117	Please order the duck!
en-unannotated-03118	We had rabbit with gnocchi.
en-unannotated-03119	Overall a great experience with fresh food from local farms!
en-unannotated-03120	They ran out of towels and we had to share one towel, staff were very apologetic though!
en-unannotated-03121	we ordered sth from room service at two different day, nobody bringed any order:)
en-unannotated-03122	The place is one long barreled roof hall.
en-unannotated-03123	Special restaurant!
en-unannotated-03124	View lovely from second floor.
en-unannotated-03125	I stayed the first time in the Artiem Madrid during a 3 days Business trip.
en-unannotated-03126	It would be nice if it didn't constantly give you the BLUE sections 49 times out of 50 make it truly random!!!
en-unannotated-03127	Clean bathrooms, romantic tables, group seating, bar seating, and family seating.
en-unannotated-03128	TV hopeless did not work
en-unannotated-03129	There is a great top floor coffee room.
en-unannotated-03130	The terrace is among the very best in Moscow (on one place with Bosco Cafe, Prichal and a couple of other places). And food is delicious.
en-unannotated-03131	We enjoyed our fish main courses here but will not return as we can eat much better elsewhere for a similar cost.
en-unannotated-03132	But just did not feel any excitement over the joint.
en-unannotated-03133	Once combined with the asparagus and yuzu it became a creamy, flavoursome flavour mix.
en-unannotated-03134	The octopus was the best I have ever had!
en-unannotated-03135	The decor is really cool, kinda dark and cozy for those dreary Dublin days but a bit over kill in the summer.
en-unannotated-03136	The lamb that was also ordered was a bit tough but also good.
en-unannotated-03137	Honestly - this is the best ice cream I have ever had.
en-unannotated-03138	The rooms are really spacious, bright and comfortable with all the amenities you need (including multi plugs and USB ports, which I love! ).
en-unannotated-03139	the decor is amazing and the whole places feels very smart but homely at the same time.
en-unannotated-03140	So why not 5 stars?
en-unannotated-03141	The walls and ceiling throughout are graciously filled with Japanese artefacts and artwork.
en-unannotated-03142	Ambience, food and drinks tick all the right boxes for Verve Restaurant and Cider House and is a must try for an inner city hide out or when in need of some quick but quality Italian.
en-unannotated-03143	staff of the hotel is really nice and helpful.
en-unannotated-03144	I traveled to Mexico City for business and I think that this hotel was the best choice I could have done.
en-unannotated-03145	Loved it, got to meet nice people.
en-unannotated-03146	The ai in the single player doesn't really represent the multiplayer game at all, with lots of infinitely circling worms(sic). You then go online when on wifi and is superb.
en-unannotated-03147	We wanted to order everything but of course it was going to be too much.
en-unannotated-03148	This is a very well known pinxtos bar specialising in mussels and lives up to its reputation.
en-unannotated-03149	My wife and I were here last night during our trip to Prague.
en-unannotated-03150	At lunch, we had a great experience; extremely tasty beer and a delicious meat and cheese plate.
en-unannotated-03151	I had ceviche with coconutmilk and a steak as a maincourse.
en-unannotated-03152	Here's how it works: it's open to the street, you walk in and someone asks you what you want to drink.
en-unannotated-03153	My wife and me stayed at this beautiful hotel to attend a friend anniversary
en-unannotated-03154	Great place!
en-unannotated-03155	On this visit, I ordered the Steamed Australian green asparagus, blue swimmer crab cake and warm yuzu mayonnaise as an entree, followed by the Kobe Cuisine wagyu sirloin with caramelised red onion sauce and sides of Steamed broccolini with garlic and parsley pangrattato and Dutch cream potato with parmesan butter and rosemary salt.
en-unannotated-03156	And it was full of Americans who had read the reviews.
en-unannotated-03157	Haven't eaten here but I'll come back from the atmosphere and snug location.
en-unannotated-03158	Enough so that I tipped them on top of what i thought was an embellished bill.
en-unannotated-03159	This is a luxury hotel in great location in Madrid.
en-unannotated-03160	Food & coffee is good !
en-unannotated-03161	The cava was cold, the chatting took off and then [NAME] showered us with a flurry of excellent, exciting, exquisite tapas!
en-unannotated-03162	I say hello to my friends outside, go inside to meet my girlfriend thats is ordering a pint for me, and realised that the bouncer its staring at me while I'm going to the door to enter, where several people passed him and he continued to stare at me (don't know why?) and when I passed beside him, keeping loving me looking at my face I said: hello how are you doing?
en-unannotated-03163	Food was great, cheap, plentiful.
en-unannotated-03164	Game will not run unless connected to internet.
en-unannotated-03165	I have to force stop 3 times in a roll for the app to work.
en-unannotated-03166	Our guests raved over the variety of dishes and of course the views.
en-unannotated-03167	Arrived late on a Sunday after flying over from London UK, and the lady on the desk gave a very warm welcome.
en-unannotated-03168	Borja was very helpful at check-in and took time to recommend area restaurants and other interests.
en-unannotated-03169	we were seated on the 2nd floor mezzanine.
en-unannotated-03170	Nice balance between creative nouveau and traditional.
en-unannotated-03171	Ordered this twice too...
en-unannotated-03172	There are no childrens options.
en-unannotated-03173	Nothing is heavily spiced.
en-unannotated-03174	Fancy, delicious, top quality everything!
en-unannotated-03175	Everything I had were mouth watering delicious.
en-unannotated-03176	We ate a lovely dinner in this restaurant, particularly the fish mains (sea bass and sole) which were very well prepared.
en-unannotated-03177	We went a bit overboard with the menu so sadly DID NOT have any room for dessert!
en-unannotated-03178	The half baked chocolate cake was a soufflé of sorts and we all really enjoyed it.
en-unannotated-03179	The chicken was an authentic french recipe with a special sauce - simply amazing!
en-unannotated-03180	Allergic to peppers -- they told me not to worry.
en-unannotated-03181	It was so delicious!
en-unannotated-03182	Excellent Location.
en-unannotated-03183	We are going back to try more of their dishes.
en-unannotated-03184	We had dinner there before we left the city and the experience was nothing less than a delectable French cuisine feast.
en-unannotated-03185	The furniture is brand new and extremely chique.
en-unannotated-03186	At Le Potager de Pere Thierry they aren't just doing one thing right; they are doing everything right starting with the atmosphere and ending with the drink in your hand.
en-unannotated-03187	I stayed at the hotel one night in June.
en-unannotated-03188	Poor & old furniture
en-unannotated-03189	It seems that at lunch the restaurant is all locals and for dinner it is all tourists.
en-unannotated-03190	All u have to do is oush the speed botton and zoom around the snake until he/she is so scared he/she wraps up in a little ball JUST big enough for your snake to circle around!
en-unannotated-03191	I'd perused the menu before arriving but still had trouble deciding on what to order.
en-unannotated-03192	W Mexico City was awesome.
en-unannotated-03193	Well worth the visit.
en-unannotated-03194	Chocolate cake - amazing
en-unannotated-03195	The staff didn't allow my girlfriend...
en-unannotated-03196	I wanted to give Hotel Casa Gonzalez four stars, but the bed in room 131 was terrible.
en-unannotated-03197	The room was great with windows I could open for fresh air.
en-unannotated-03198	The food is interesting and tasty, the vibe relaxed and without pretense and the service very hospitable and friendly.
en-unannotated-03199	Our party of three went to the bar for drinks while waiting on our table.
en-unannotated-03200	Others in my group had the salmon, steak boxty, and Guinness and beef stew.
en-unannotated-03201	They asked if we wanted food and we said we wanted some coffee and they told us we couldn't come in.
en-unannotated-03202	Mm pancakes were delightful!!
en-unannotated-03203	so annoying..
en-unannotated-03204	This might be coming from a tourist, but after spending so much time in Europe and trying other foods...
en-unannotated-03205	Nothing over the top, nor basic.
en-unannotated-03206	Don't get fooled by the advertised photos, this is NOT a 5* by any standard - nothing classy or upscale here.
en-unannotated-03207	4). Great food.
en-unannotated-03208	The menu was not huge but every offering seemed better than the next.
en-unannotated-03209	Asked one guy said grab any table.
en-unannotated-03210	Next Pappa al Pomodoro with Buffalo Stracciatella, a slightly warm Tuscan tomato soup.
en-unannotated-03211	For food, I got the Gnocchi de Oscar which was hands down the most delicious gnocchi I've ever eaten.
en-unannotated-03212	I am already looking forward to seeing what else Survey Co will come up with!
en-unannotated-03213	Let's keep it g-rated.
en-unannotated-03214	We love this place, and my dog does too!
en-unannotated-03215	However, this is not a 'fine dining' restaurant although pricing would indicate that it is.
en-unannotated-03216	They have a sit in cafe where you can dine in and enjoy coffee...
en-unannotated-03217	I decided to try the Irish stew which was the more healthier version according to the waiter.
en-unannotated-03218	The créme brûlée was great, but what completely shocked me was the sorbet that accompanied the dish: CELERY sorbet (not a typo, people!).
en-unannotated-03219	They have AC and smoking is prohibited inside.
en-unannotated-03220	Very friendly and welcoming staff, excellent location let's you walk to most main attractions and shopping areas, very impressive interior public areas deserving of the name Grand.
en-unannotated-03221	Absolutely thumbs up!
en-unannotated-03222	5 stars.
en-unannotated-03223	We ordered a risotto after some struggles to understand the menu which was in french.
en-unannotated-03224	If you wanted to wash your hands while sitting on the toilet it was that close.
en-unannotated-03225	Furniture tattered and out dated
en-unannotated-03226	Staff are very helpful and friendly, Luis helped us with lot of information about Mexico City such as tours, events and places to eat.
en-unannotated-03227	They cooked the duck just right and therefore the flavor coming from the meat was outstanding in both entrees.
en-unannotated-03228	You walk in and feel like you are in someone's home.
en-unannotated-03229	They have a bell you can hit but it takes the waiter awhile to come after you ring them.
en-unannotated-03230	
en-unannotated-03231	Staff were so friendly and helpful.
en-unannotated-03232	It was our last day in Ireland and our livers were barely keeping up, so we decided to give them a break and just get food.
en-unannotated-03233	My husband thought his was just 'ok' and he eats anything and never complains.
en-unannotated-03234	That gets very frustrating after a while.
en-unannotated-03235	Because we had rented a car for the first week we weren't sure what time to schedule the original pick up for our stay at Hotel dei Barbieri so we just took a taxi after returning the car to the airport.
en-unannotated-03236	This may be a good game for all people and kids too but some people have weird nicknames like Nolan the hacker.
en-unannotated-03237	The staff was attentive to all my needs.
en-unannotated-03238	I ordered French onion soup and foie gras.
en-unannotated-03239	That was a mistake, more like a chewing gum.
en-unannotated-03240	Location was very good
en-unannotated-03241	The hotel was spotless, the people so kind, the decor trendy (if a bit overdone), and the room was very comfortable.
en-unannotated-03242	Great room size, and the kids loved the indoor/outdoor pool.
en-unannotated-03243	The service was very good..
en-unannotated-03244	I was keen on the slow cooked lamb shoulder but the others preferred to order their own meals.
en-unannotated-03245	Thanks
en-unannotated-03246	Room was too hot and aircon not working
en-unannotated-03247	Smooth stay.
en-unannotated-03248	We stayed for just one night but extended this to a late checkout.
en-unannotated-03249	Amazing service, the best coffee in town, Clean and simple, but the guys behind the bar are awesome...
en-unannotated-03250	We stayed in apartments throughout our holiday across Europe and all of them were privately owned.
en-unannotated-03251	There's no star rating change but I finally trundled along to check out JMH by night, aka the bar side of this little dual purpose venue.
en-unannotated-03252	Dined here with my family when we were visiting Australia.
en-unannotated-03253	On another morning, he was sleeping on the sofa for customers in the lobby, which I think is unimaginable in other hotels.
en-unannotated-03254	When the dish was served the immediate thought is of the gigantic blob of grated cheese that is visible.
en-unannotated-03255	Highly Recommended.
en-unannotated-03256	Walk in, find some space, look at the big pics on the walls (varieties of mussels or calamari), point and order and eat!
en-unannotated-03257	I took  suite there was no  water kettle  Or tea or coffee not even water where usually we can find it in even 3 stars hotel and the tv only 2 or 3 channels speaks English..
en-unannotated-03258	Soooo fresh and lovely!
en-unannotated-03259	A stellar stay!
en-unannotated-03260	CZK 250 (~$10 or EUR9 at time of writing)
en-unannotated-03261	the gratin was delicious and a good portion too!
en-unannotated-03262	The lobby is small, but charming.
en-unannotated-03263	The place was pretty busy.
en-unannotated-03264	The service was excellent and the owner was very friendly.
en-unannotated-03265	Hotel is surrounded by fence.
en-unannotated-03266	Very kind people and really good service!
en-unannotated-03267	Clean, comfortable, excellent food when you come back tired and you need some rest.
en-unannotated-03268	The rooms are impeccably clean and the beds are cozy.
en-unannotated-03269	Just a heads up, there's a 2% surcharge when paying by card.
en-unannotated-03270	The tacos de cochinita is recommended, very tender...
en-unannotated-03271	I would come again.
en-unannotated-03272	You can't even use single player as training, is that disparate from the genuinely joyous/incredibly frustrating multiplayer that really makes this game worth downloading.
en-unannotated-03273	The hotel is very well appointed, the room clean and had everything you could want.
en-unannotated-03274	The staff at this Hotel are great and extremely helpful.
en-unannotated-03275	One of the best burgers I've ever had!
en-unannotated-03276	I would stay here again.
en-unannotated-03277	For the...
en-unannotated-03278	Getting boring now that I've gotten all the coins for all the levels, pink, purple, grey, except maybe 1 level cause they made it imposibile to get them.
en-unannotated-03279	Accompanied by a relish, leaf salad and skinny fries not a single crumb was left on the plate (wooden board).
en-unannotated-03280	I decided to go there once I know they are good at mussels.
en-unannotated-03281	We recently attended a destination wedding where our extended family stayed at Hotel Estelar La Fontana.
en-unannotated-03282	I hope you are as lucky to stop by as I felt when dining there!
en-unannotated-03283	Very nicely prepared and spiced and served with a very tasty fried rye bread.
en-unannotated-03284	The removal of "last active" and "moments" really left a sour taste in my mouth.
en-unannotated-03285	Weekday early casual lunch
en-unannotated-03286	Many ingredients/textures.
en-unannotated-03287	Yummy in my tummy!
en-unannotated-03288	A menu with a full range of exquisite, intricate and innovative dishes that were reasonably priced for a fine dining establishment!
en-unannotated-03289	I wish there was more toasted bread that came with it!
en-unannotated-03290	Had the seafood pasta and my friend had the black ink risotto.
en-unannotated-03291	I loved it.
en-unannotated-03292	1. Sea bream carpaccio with a citrus dressing, herbed creme fraiche, toasted buckwheat.
en-unannotated-03293	A finished Old Fashioned was placed under a glass dome and smoke from oak chips was "fired" into the glass.
en-unannotated-03294	Small room, but fairly quiet.
en-unannotated-03295	In all honesty, I never had haloumi before.
en-unannotated-03296	Will be back on my next trip!
en-unannotated-03297	The fish & chips were amazing!
en-unannotated-03298	We visited around 12-1 PM and there was a bit of a line to order but most people seemed to be taking their food for takeaway so we were able to find a table to eat at without any issue.
en-unannotated-03299	After a disappointing experience at a “famous” Michelin star restaurant in Madrid a few nights before, we were hopeful the last dinner of our vacation in Madrid would be memorable.
en-unannotated-03300	It also helped that the service was outsanding.
en-unannotated-03301	Had the grilled octopus on potato-cheese gratin (excellent) and continued to the Lomo...
en-unannotated-03302	The food and service are both outstanding!
en-unannotated-03303	We stumbled on this little gem as it looked the busiest!
en-unannotated-03304	This is the best thing you can discover in an alleyway.
en-unannotated-03305	There are two cheese dishes.
en-unannotated-03306	We booked this hotel because of the good comments on TripAdvisor, and have stayed there for 3 days.
en-unannotated-03307	Push notifications stopped working!
en-unannotated-03308	They paired a glass of wine for us and it came to 64 euros for 2 glasses of wine, 2 apps and 2 mains.
en-unannotated-03309	Had to go down to 3 stars since I can't challenge my friends.
en-unannotated-03310	The beef goulash and the grilled salmon dish were delicious.
en-unannotated-03311	We also had the duck entree.
en-unannotated-03312	The concierge room is small and the food is just average.
en-unannotated-03313	So happy I stayed there.
en-unannotated-03314	I wish I tried the goulash though!
en-unannotated-03315	The burger was excellent, with all fresh ingredients.
en-unannotated-03316	Delicious!
en-unannotated-03317	We are going back tomorrow
en-unannotated-03318	From the presentation, they all look the same, but they all have a different taste.
en-unannotated-03319	Cacio e pepe over a Grana Padano bed and the ragú that is one of the best bolognese sauces I ever had.
en-unannotated-03320	4 walls.
en-unannotated-03321	One night we split the Pasta alla Norma, a Sicilian recipe with fresh pasta, pan sautéed eggplant, tomato sauce and pecorino cheese.
en-unannotated-03322	There is one line for buying raw meat to bring home and one line to order cooked food.
en-unannotated-03323	Our server was pleasant enough and the food didn't take too-too long to come out.
en-unannotated-03324	right around the corner from conveyor belt tourist eateries, your extra effort to find this retro-themed restaurant will be rewarded with excellent quality, reasonably-priced fine fare and delightful eye candy surroundings!
en-unannotated-03325	It's not at all greasy and has great flavor.
en-unannotated-03326	We had arrived late in the evening and the hotel recommended this nearby restaurant.
en-unannotated-03327	Since the check in the service was horrible.
en-unannotated-03328	a surprise awaits!
en-unannotated-03329	Service: 5 stars
en-unannotated-03330	But very tasty!
en-unannotated-03331	We've eaten here a few times and always had an enjoyable meal.
en-unannotated-03332	The day of my flight i asked for a late check out and they let me stay untill 18:00 with no extra charge.
en-unannotated-03333	Breakfast was excellent- breakfast room a little overcrowded with furniture.
en-unannotated-03334	After driving for 10 hours I got in at 10am.
en-unannotated-03335	Instead, my friends and I decided to venture across the street to Sedm konšelů where we were promptly seated in their lovely interior courtyard and the food we ordered came out within minutes after being seated.
en-unannotated-03336	This place is definitely a tourist trap.
en-unannotated-03337	If you love historical places this hotel is amazing.
en-unannotated-03338	PERFECT!
en-unannotated-03339	Highly recommended
en-unannotated-03340	While eating my steak, there was too much blood when I cut it open, prompting me to wonder how long exactly it was dry-aged for.
en-unannotated-03341	Not gushy service at the bar but very efficient, so not bothered about that at all.
en-unannotated-03342	Don't go here if you are afraid of raw meat; the difference between the tartare and hamburger is basically only different seasoning plus a light sear on the outside of the hamburger!
en-unannotated-03343	They are f...ing amazing!!
en-unannotated-03344	Because this restaurant is so small it can get real busy real fast, especially if you don't arrive right when it opens its doors for dinner.
en-unannotated-03345	The view was nice and the ambiance of the restaurant is good.
en-unannotated-03346	Really, what I love, is the feeling that I am in a "real" Italian restaurant.
en-unannotated-03347	Highly recommend!
en-unannotated-03348	The check-in staff were lovely.
en-unannotated-03349	But the delivered dishes fall flat.
en-unannotated-03350	Such a quaint restaurant with amazing service and as friendly staff.
en-unannotated-03351	SO so kind.
en-unannotated-03352	The staff were utterly charming and we really enjoyed...
en-unannotated-03353	A lot of cheaters as well.
en-unannotated-03354	This place has fantastic reviews and I'd concur that the food is great/service is decent...
en-unannotated-03355	Recommend!
en-unannotated-03356	The fresh food was great.
en-unannotated-03357	Cute, intimate, romantic, authentic, the French bistro that breathes the essence of Paris.
en-unannotated-03358	Our fist dish of soup- was a moth on top.
en-unannotated-03359	We eat spicy food all the time.
en-unannotated-03360	Not too much coffee flavour, perfectly balanced.
en-unannotated-03361	Obviously.
en-unannotated-03362	Needs a brand new air conditioning and heating system!
en-unannotated-03363	The place is very pleasant, the waitress that was also one of the owners is a nice modest lady.
en-unannotated-03364	well enjoyed the food and vibe of this place...
en-unannotated-03365	Be sure to make a reservation!
en-unannotated-03366	It's close to the subway station and a taxi stand.
en-unannotated-03367	The Popcorn Shrimp (with a spicy creamy dipping sauce of the gods) and the Waygu Terrine - just a tip for when you shall undoubtedly visit!
en-unannotated-03368	After two years I finally got to experience this restaurant!
en-unannotated-03369	The indoor pool is amazing.
en-unannotated-03370	Great place to have a meal!
en-unannotated-03371	As I was solo and there are only 3 bar tables with 2 stools and no bar seating, which being solo works in my favor to just sit and eat at the bar.
en-unannotated-03372	It was just okay
en-unannotated-03373	There are better options in the area.
en-unannotated-03374	Be sure to save room for the Fromage and desert courses!!
en-unannotated-03375	The atmosphere of Brew is so welcoming that it's probably the only place I'd go to dine by myself without feeling uncomfortable.
en-unannotated-03376	Luckily second time here we went further inside.
en-unannotated-03377	They assisted with any requests.
en-unannotated-03378	It doesn't disappoint.
en-unannotated-03379	If you have read my previous reviews, they are extremely positive and nothing has changed.
en-unannotated-03380	We came at around 10:30 am but were seated immediately.
en-unannotated-03381	I visited the venue in both its forms, the cocktail bar version was what really impressed me.
en-unannotated-03382	For a main course my daughter had the veal, I had the steak with a shallot wine reduction.
en-unannotated-03383	And it's probably some of the best French food I've had in Paris!!
en-unannotated-03384	I've added all of the updates and because my phone is new I know its not my phone.
en-unannotated-03385	The next day (Saturday) we went to the reception and asked her if she can kindly book us a table for two people at zuma for dinner she have responded straight away saying it is not possible I have already asked because another person asked me to ask for a booking it's fully booked ..
en-unannotated-03386	The grilled vegetables were cooked to perfection.
en-unannotated-03387	The popcorn shrimp was crunchy fun and the garlic chicken, juicy and tender.
en-unannotated-03388	not so much.
en-unannotated-03389	Whether there for the House Pilsner Beer which is pretty darn good (but then the Czechs make the world's best beer...
en-unannotated-03390	And already I'm resolving to return (even though I left /lost an iPhone 6plus earlier that evening at the Rizzoli bookstore within the previously mentioned Vittorio Emanuelle) So you can understand that the warmth and welcome of the restaurant is comforting- a Calgon moment sans the bubbles ...
en-unannotated-03391	The service has been excellent.
en-unannotated-03392	I would go again and be more thoughtful about my ordering.
en-unannotated-03393	Considering the price we paid, it was lacking finishing touches like tea and coffee making facilities and even a couple of bottles of water on arrival.
en-unannotated-03394	Starters were good.
en-unannotated-03395	We quietly mentioned it to our server and she said she would report it to the kitchen.
en-unannotated-03396	Excellent service.
en-unannotated-03397	The food was good but I've had better.
en-unannotated-03398	And many times the coins are also not credited after watching videos.
en-unannotated-03399	About ten minutes after my plates were cleared, my steak came.
en-unannotated-03400	I would definitely recommend this place to a friend and demand that they order the squid ink risotto!
en-unannotated-03401	creative tapas!
en-unannotated-03402	The chef love to cook and as a guest you can feel and taste it :D
en-unannotated-03403	The people were friendly and very helpful with directions and got me into a room early.
en-unannotated-03404	Great freshly cooked burger and wrap here.
en-unannotated-03405	You pay for what you get.
en-unannotated-03406	Only a handful of lucky gringos.
en-unannotated-03407	The fact that it is open early everyday is ideal for people who don't work a typical 9-5. On more than one occasion I have found myself at a loss in the city, trying to find decent coffee, until i remember reliable lil' BREW, tucked away in Burnett Lane.
en-unannotated-03408	Lovely hotel with really special personal touches.
en-unannotated-03409	And the waiter and waitress were friendly and knowledgable enough to recommend some star dishes since it's our first.
en-unannotated-03410	Eat the skin early, it gets tough.
en-unannotated-03411	Service is also very good.
en-unannotated-03412	What great food!
en-unannotated-03413	We were on the 10th floor and the club service and restaurant facility were very convenient.
en-unannotated-03414	Ordered several tipical dishes, great mix of Spain and France cousine in Basque region: as fois gras, xangurro.
en-unannotated-03415	for your recommendation.
en-unannotated-03416	It's pretty much a fancy tourist trap.
en-unannotated-03417	Definitely make a reservation if you can for dinner.
en-unannotated-03418	Service is given above and beyond!
en-unannotated-03419	However my husband liked his steak and eggplant filled zucchini cups.
en-unannotated-03420	seeing a theme here about great food?
en-unannotated-03421	As titled, this is a wonderful boutique hotel.
en-unannotated-03422	The server couldn't give an estimate as to when a table would be available, so we decided not to wait.
en-unannotated-03423	We could not have selected a better property for our weekend.
en-unannotated-03424	The candle sticks look as if they fell fresh out of the pages of a Sherlock Holmes novel and would'nt look out of place perched on the mantlepiece in 221b baker street.
en-unannotated-03425	- Burger was tough, dry, overdone
en-unannotated-03426	Good place for business travelers.
en-unannotated-03427	She was also nice enough to throw in a cold pea soup (couldn't remember what the waiter said was in it) but there was a nice chunk of cheese in the middle.
en-unannotated-03428	If I didn't really want to watch some of the programmes I would never try to access it.
en-unannotated-03429	The hotel, the staff, and the Concierge were excellent, very helpful and even the doormen made us feel very welcome.
en-unannotated-03430	As a solo travel with basically no French, dining has been a source of stress.
en-unannotated-03431	Please make sure you research the proper etiquette for eating in a French restaurant, so you are not offended by the different in culture.
en-unannotated-03432	We had the prosciutto, arugula, and parmesan pie, which they graciously split for us before bringing it out to our table, and the seafood spaghetti.
en-unannotated-03433	I love that they have little booths so you can get some separation from the crowd but you need to be there super early to get one.
en-unannotated-03434	I have the special, I was a cut with a creamy sauce the only good thing about the dish.
en-unannotated-03435	Luckily I finally ordered when I did because a minute after ordering, people appeared out of nowhere to form a long line which seemed to last the entire time we were there.
en-unannotated-03436	So last weekend we took some friends to the Survey Co thinking we were on a sure thing.
en-unannotated-03437	Food is good but nothing special.
en-unannotated-03438	We had a very pleasant dinner and experience at this place.
en-unannotated-03439	Really atmospheric place.
en-unannotated-03440	Excellent Breakfast Buffet.
en-unannotated-03441	Five course meal with wine pairings for 50$ a head.
en-unannotated-03442	It was exciting to discuss food and wine with the hosts who was very knowledgeable and taught us a lot about...
en-unannotated-03443	Great room service.
en-unannotated-03444	Meh, an average decent burger.
en-unannotated-03445	I rated it a 4 at first because it forced me to rate it before I even started the app.
en-unannotated-03446	Really boring faux pop music needs to give way to the Dubliners, the Clancy Brothers, and the Wolfetones and others.
en-unannotated-03447	Try and call for a reservation if possible...
en-unannotated-03448	Exceptional.
en-unannotated-03449	The foie gras comes with newly toasted bread to even out the flavors.
en-unannotated-03450	We visited auberge du prunelli after being recommended.
en-unannotated-03451	Service was attentive.
en-unannotated-03452	The food was excellent, the apartment was beautiful and she was a gracious and generous hostess.
en-unannotated-03453	The side salad was not impressive and a basic garden salad.
en-unannotated-03454	Is there any functionality changed in Chromecast/android/google home update?
en-unannotated-03455	Atmosphere and service was cozy, inviting, and personal.
en-unannotated-03456	Perfect for a late afternoon rest.
en-unannotated-03457	15 minutes from Trevi fountain.
en-unannotated-03458	Service was fast and friendly.
en-unannotated-03459	and no splinters :)
en-unannotated-03460	We celebrated a milestone birthday here.
en-unannotated-03461	I bought the cocoa tablets to try making it at home.
en-unannotated-03462	!
en-unannotated-03463	I would not stay elsewhere unless forced to when I come back.
en-unannotated-03464	Took my coeliac mother here several times during her stay because the food was so good.
en-unannotated-03465	It is an intimate, cozy restaurant that probably seats at most 10. The waiter was incredibly friendly and helpful in explaining the meals, specials, and drinks!
en-unannotated-03466	turned out staying in the Certosa neighborhood may have had the disadvantage of distance from downtown and Milano Centrale the food choices were outstanding.
en-unannotated-03467	Rooms were clean.
en-unannotated-03468	Now showing an error sort it out!
en-unannotated-03469	Take a date here, she will love it!
en-unannotated-03470	Had an issue with seating and rushed service.
en-unannotated-03471	Looking for a good Italian restaurant which isn't too pricy we found out about this awesome place!
en-unannotated-03472	Everything was delicious and fresh.
en-unannotated-03473	As a starter we had deep fried onion rings.
en-unannotated-03474	The surroundings and décor are impressive without being pompous.
en-unannotated-03475	The lighting.
en-unannotated-03476	For me it is all about the Beef Goulash which is served in a loaf of bread (similar to the Clam Chowder at Boudin's in San Francisco) which was the perfect meal when washed down with a local beer after walking around a cold Prague.
en-unannotated-03477	Unlike other games, if your phone breaks and you have to get a new one, when you log into Gmail, everything should transfer over!
en-unannotated-03478	The receptionist recommended their beautiful restaurant in the lobby of hotel.
en-unannotated-03479	but okay, they were very busy...
en-unannotated-03480	Just got to Prague.
en-unannotated-03481	We went based on TripAdvisor reviews, and it was close to our apartment for the visit.
en-unannotated-03482	This place is great, but needs more attention to detail by the cleaners or changeover staff.
en-unannotated-03483	This restaurant was AMAZING!
en-unannotated-03484	The oil and vinegar they use is delicious.
en-unannotated-03485	Five star service all around.
en-unannotated-03486	HIGHLY recommend for those visiting Dublin & looking for high quality food!
en-unannotated-03487	The lobby doesn't exist currently, as it's under construction.
en-unannotated-03488	A walk away from city attractions and Shopping.
en-unannotated-03489	Many...
en-unannotated-03490	We were able to snag a last minute reservation for right when the restaurant opened.
en-unannotated-03491	I love its filters and bitmojis.
en-unannotated-03492	Totally recommended!
en-unannotated-03493	This place is really friendly to English speakers.
en-unannotated-03494	My girl ordered the gnocchi with bacon and zucchini....
en-unannotated-03495	This was our very first dinner when we landed in Italy.
en-unannotated-03496	Having said that, we were delighted with our stay.
en-unannotated-03497	GREAT VALUE
en-unannotated-03498	More dressing and this dish would have been perfect!
en-unannotated-03499	It might just be the cocktails and wine talking, I found food and drinks and service here to be extraordinary.
en-unannotated-03500	My husband ordered Schnitzel and loved it.
en-unannotated-03501	We stayed here for 3 nights in May and were very happy with our stay.
en-unannotated-03502	and after I insisted totally surprised and pissed he says like you are not passing here!
en-unannotated-03503	A special mention to the potatoes which were just to die for.
en-unannotated-03504	You walk into a darker room that has a doorway to another room, that leads to outside sitting!
en-unannotated-03505	Very good service and friendly staff.
en-unannotated-03506	We wanted to go out of our comfort zone, so we asked the owner to pick our appetizers and entrees for us.
en-unannotated-03507	They seem to specialize in gratinees, each with different ingredients.
en-unannotated-03508	Black Squid Risotto was a shocker.
en-unannotated-03509	Hotel staff very helpful.
en-unannotated-03510	They offer very traditional Russian food, tasty and fresh food.
en-unannotated-03511	Is one of the best places to visit!!
en-unannotated-03512	It did not disappoint.
en-unannotated-03513	The steak was overcooked so it was quite tough to eat.
en-unannotated-03514	A group of us had a great meal here.
en-unannotated-03515	Bathroom dated and needs an upgrade.
en-unannotated-03516	I thought he was silly for getting fried chicken in Ireland when we're from the states (not because I didn't think it would be good, but because I thought he might want to venture away from American food while we're visiting another continent) but the fries and aioli were soooo I good I ended up being very happy with what he ordered!
en-unannotated-03517	The plate as a whole was delicious and immensely satiating.
en-unannotated-03518	I shouldn't have to pay $9.99 a month to listen to 3 minute songs.
en-unannotated-03519	There is a limited range of food and drinks and the cafe is exactly as described by its...
en-unannotated-03520	All of the tables were made out of old sewing machine tables.
en-unannotated-03521	The...
en-unannotated-03522	All the food we got were good.
en-unannotated-03523	Dinner was amazing, friends and I had the oysters on the half shell as an appetizer and they where excellent.
en-unannotated-03524	Ingredients are top notch, including grass fed Angus and beautiful brioche.
en-unannotated-03525	Sine we are a vegan and a vegetarian dinner they accommodate...
en-unannotated-03526	Still impeccable facilities with an amazing service.
en-unannotated-03527	Make sure to have a reservation for dinner.
en-unannotated-03528	Very tiny tables so get ready to be very close to the next table.
en-unannotated-03529	Floor was vacuumed but not mopped so our feet were filthy if we took off our shoes.
en-unannotated-03530	Very convenient to airport.
en-unannotated-03531	Of course it's not free, but at least it's just a one time payment (unlike other premium gaming apps). My only major complaint is that it doesn't let you play your own music.
en-unannotated-03532	Beautifully situated at the top of Zurriola beach.
en-unannotated-03533	My husband ordered the fried chicken in butter with the potato salad as a side and said it was all very good.
en-unannotated-03534	Nice honest staff, pretty decent pasta plate, great atmosphere and yes, location!
en-unannotated-03535	Extras: No side dishes required with this dish as it is quite a big serve, plus its own salad.
en-unannotated-03536	The food was absolutely amazing (French onion soup, duck, goat cheese...
en-unannotated-03537	My husband had beer and I had wine.
en-unannotated-03538	Loved the trout and salmon.
en-unannotated-03539	A little far from downtown.
en-unannotated-03540	Will be making this a must visit spot for anyone we know going to Paris.
en-unannotated-03541	Staff were great.
en-unannotated-03542	Can't complain about this hotel.
en-unannotated-03543	She put them in the oven to cook and we waited.
en-unannotated-03544	Maybe other dishes were better, and the place (with backyard) was pretty nice.
en-unannotated-03545	I've been here so many times, if I ever think: "fancy dinner in the city?
en-unannotated-03546	I think it's one of the most popular dishes here as everyone around us was indulging.
en-unannotated-03547	Every time I try to open it the app crashes.
en-unannotated-03548	Location is unbeatable; without this location it will be a nice normal hotel.
en-unannotated-03549	He was very accommodating to non-Spanish speakers.
en-unannotated-03550	When we arrived to John Mills Himself I spotted a couple of things that bear striking resemblance to my favourite coffee shop back in Melbourne and discovered they offer the same roasts.
en-unannotated-03551	Good conversation about taste, food and cooking.
en-unannotated-03552	Has the same vibe.
en-unannotated-03553	Very helpful staff with lots of suggestions on great local places to eat at.
en-unannotated-03554	It costs you 9 Euros for a cup, but you are only here once right?
en-unannotated-03555	Absolutely amazing food and a wonderful dining experience.
en-unannotated-03556	Prices were low and service was really nice.
en-unannotated-03557	La Valise was the perfect choice for my first visit to Mexico City and the calm yet vibrant leafy Roma Norte neighborhood is the perfect respite after a long day of touring.
en-unannotated-03558	Although with a few hiccups, overall I had a nice stay at this hotel for 7 nights last week.
en-unannotated-03559	The hotel is very nice.
en-unannotated-03560	Great music live performance.
en-unannotated-03561	Attentive, happy to discuss options and recommendations very friendly staff but not over the top.
en-unannotated-03562	The decor is very Gatsby-esque and that is clearly the theme of the place.
en-unannotated-03563	If u liked my review, then search Courtney72WH00 friend and follow, if u follow me, I will follow u!
en-unannotated-03564	Turandot is in the same family of restaurants as the more popular Cafe Pushkin.
en-unannotated-03565	Usually very busy in the evenings, can be hard to get a table.
en-unannotated-03566	A bunch of my friends ordered the goulash - another traditional Czech food - and were wowed as well.
en-unannotated-03567	Go for the food, but don't expect good service.
en-unannotated-03568	It's a place to dine knowing your experience will be of high quality, a place to dine solo or with friends and certainly to remind even locals there's something wonderful happening in our city!
en-unannotated-03569	I know what you're thinking...
en-unannotated-03570	Had super high expectation sadly disappointed.
en-unannotated-03571	Very good service and food is excellent.
en-unannotated-03572	All sites were within walking distance.
en-unannotated-03573	I had never made it to The Cheese Pantry, the original name for this location.
en-unannotated-03574	I'm using Chromecast from last one year.
en-unannotated-03575	Nice, friendly staff with quick service.
en-unannotated-03576	Taxi.
en-unannotated-03577	Cacio e pepe spaghetti and orechiette al ragú.
en-unannotated-03578	2) rooms are small
en-unannotated-03579	Based on the reviews on TripAdvisor we visited this restaurant.
en-unannotated-03580	Bring your appetite!
en-unannotated-03581	It's in a basement and it was very loud when we were there for a late dinner on our first night in Brisbane.
en-unannotated-03582	The crème brûlée is made to order and is also really rich and flavorful.
en-unannotated-03583	I do not want to reopen Spotify and click on play every single time I close my other applications.
en-unannotated-03584	I strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys fine dining and new food experiences!
en-unannotated-03585	Modern rooms with good facilities, Very clean, fast and swift check-in - no issues encountered.
en-unannotated-03586	The only thing that could be...
en-unannotated-03587	But you know that you'll only be thinking the entire time of the blue cheese risotto you COULD be eating instead.
en-unannotated-03588	A bottle of the house rose will only set you back 10 euros, half a bottle 5.
en-unannotated-03589	You will never get this at any US restaurants.
en-unannotated-03590	Which was the most delicious lot cooked duck I've ever had.
en-unannotated-03591	We exchanged e mails and booked a table for 9pm and whilst we were the first, within...
en-unannotated-03592	The hotel is still in quite good shape and service attitude has improve a lot since our last stay
en-unannotated-03593	It came with one random salami in it.
en-unannotated-03594	Would have given 0 stars if possible.
en-unannotated-03595	Thank you so much for opening your home.
en-unannotated-03596	Tip: this place fills up quickly, but if it is full here and you can't get seated, you can walk a few more meters to le Jardin, same owner same menu, almost across the street.
en-unannotated-03597	Rest assured, you picked a good spot..
en-unannotated-03598	Hidden down an unassuming laneway off Albert street, Brew is undoubtedly one of the city's finest hipster hangouts.
en-unannotated-03599	The best place in Prague for small plates and authentic beers.
en-unannotated-03600	And then they load up the poke on top.
en-unannotated-03601	For dessert, we got the brownie and it was heavenly.
en-unannotated-03602	We admitted we didn't know what to order.
en-unannotated-03603	Good location
en-unannotated-03604	And after all of that, all I see when I open the app is a "Login with  Facebook" button.
en-unannotated-03605	It is a small place and seems to be gaining in popularity so you probably need a reservation.
en-unannotated-03606	We did the 5 course with wine pairing for 54 euros and it was worth every penny.
en-unannotated-03607	View was great.
en-unannotated-03608	Central location; sweet shop.
en-unannotated-03609	I have come across times where these restrictions posed as challenges when going out.
en-unannotated-03610	Food from favorite to least.
en-unannotated-03611	The music and ambience were spot on.
en-unannotated-03612	The sausages and meatloaf came out almost immediately, while the cheeseburger was going to take about 15 minutes.
en-unannotated-03613	We ordered the veal Milanese - amazing!
en-unannotated-03614	I went with an 18E version that included shaved truffles, but with the subsequent education in how amazing and flavorful these mushrooms can be, I wonder why the truffles here were so tame in comparison (perhaps they were summer truffles?
en-unannotated-03615	We chose this place from all the rave reviews on trip advisor.
en-unannotated-03616	You need the same standards for the desktop version and the app.
en-unannotated-03617	Very spacious and comfortable room overlooking a beautiful garden, it's next to a local shopping centre where you can find a food court, restaurants and Juan Valdez (a popular cafe chain in Columbia). Free coffee provided in room.
en-unannotated-03618	Their risotto is made with milk in a traditional recipe.
en-unannotated-03619	It is a five star hotel in a five star location.
en-unannotated-03620	International guests.
en-unannotated-03621	We had free bread, dried tomatoes in oil, free meatballs , insalata caprese and fried bread, homemade lasagne and homemade linguini with shrimps , 2 drinks!
en-unannotated-03622	Had the goat cheese and beetroot salad as well, my least favorite of the meal; beer was a bit too firm and not pickled enough for my liking.
en-unannotated-03623	Owned by mom with the son as a chef, we were treated extremely well and had one of the best dining experiences during our vacation in northern Italy.
en-unannotated-03624	We had the tasting menu (with the premium flight of wines) with Caviar tasting and it was sensational.
en-unannotated-03625	Steak tartar?
en-unannotated-03626	I had a great Hendricks gin to start.
en-unannotated-03627	I can't hear my stream without manually entering into search the song I want to hear!
en-unannotated-03628	12-7 pm, £20 for an starter and a main course.
en-unannotated-03629	Plenty of space.
en-unannotated-03630	We will definitely come back soon.
en-unannotated-03631	Quality of the beef and tuna we ordered was very good and the deserts were good as well.
en-unannotated-03632	The avocado toast was good with the ricotta and squeeze of lemon and they gave plenty of pieces of bacon for the 3.50 surcharge.
en-unannotated-03633	Nevertheless worth a visit...
en-unannotated-03634	We were served a nice slice of fois gras that came with an oniony fruit jelly and bread.
en-unannotated-03635	This game when we play it it is very slow after a while it is fast.
en-unannotated-03636	Despite our various requests nothing was done about it.
en-unannotated-03637	It really is very good.
en-unannotated-03638	I have traveled worldwide and made a great number of bookings on booking.
en-unannotated-03639	This is a luxurious hotel with excellent location.
en-unannotated-03640	Unfortunately, we were told, they were yet to find a great Australian cider and as such weren't offering any right now.
en-unannotated-03641	There are several great restaurants in the complex.
en-unannotated-03642	This is why I love yelp - going to a top rated restaurant that meets all expectations!
en-unannotated-03643	We discovered this little restaurant around the corner from our hotel, and such a great find it was!
en-unannotated-03644	We got the trio of Irish spring lamb serving for two.
en-unannotated-03645	Use uber instead
en-unannotated-03646	We nailed a couple of cocktails - back to the Mancora and Macho Margarita.
en-unannotated-03647	Nice location with good food and a relaxed atmosphere.
en-unannotated-03648	(3 beers, 1 soup, 2 dinners, 2 sides, 1 dessert, and espresso came to about 550 CZK) Many locals here and probably tourists too drinking beer and eating.
en-unannotated-03649	But even after I rated it 4 stars, it didn't let me open the app.
en-unannotated-03650	Poor quality old needs major renovation
en-unannotated-03651	The staff is amazing and super friendly.
en-unannotated-03652	The tables and chairs are fit for children to sit at and are totally impractical.
en-unannotated-03653	The hot chocolate was, of course, fabulous.
en-unannotated-03654	Oh my yum!
en-unannotated-03655	We went at lunchtime with the kids and put the little on on the back-wall counter (standing only). Favorites were the mussels marineras and calamar pimiento (up...
en-unannotated-03656	This might be a good place for a group of friends to have some cheap beers and fare, but for a meal this place is incredibly casual.
en-unannotated-03657	Recent update is a significant downgrade to the apps functionality.
en-unannotated-03658	I mopped up all the sauce with the bread they provided.
en-unannotated-03659	The staff was very friendly and spoke English well.
en-unannotated-03660	In a red painted container in the heart of CBD, Brisbane you will find this burger joint.
en-unannotated-03661	The amuse bouche and the digestif are nice touches.
en-unannotated-03662	Gorgeous atmosphere...
en-unannotated-03663	I suspect John Mills Himself changes with the hour and day...
en-unannotated-03664	I got the pan seared foie gras.
en-unannotated-03665	No, it won't break if you climb aboard.
en-unannotated-03666	The second, dinner with visiting in-laws and hoping to impress them with Brisbane's one laneway charm.
en-unannotated-03667	Immediately greeted and sat at one of the wooden tables.
en-unannotated-03668	The entire experience was so quintessentially French.
en-unannotated-03669	The food was excellent!
en-unannotated-03670	60euro worth of food/drink for 29euro.
en-unannotated-03671	- Eye-soaring extraordinarily poor room decor, ex: lamp shades made out of stapled paper;
en-unannotated-03672	If I get to Brisbane again, I WILL come back.
en-unannotated-03673	Our server invited us to return during his scheduled days.
en-unannotated-03674	Unique experience.
en-unannotated-03675	Fantastic spot for breakfast!
en-unannotated-03676	Was here a few years ago and it has stuck in my mind ever since.
en-unannotated-03677	Go to have breakfast but you need to get there early as it is always packed and no reservations are allowed.
en-unannotated-03678	:)
en-unannotated-03679	I have stayed at many an airport hotel in my life and this was possibly the best.
en-unannotated-03680	- creme brûlée: 5/5. Amazing!!!
en-unannotated-03681	The lemonade I...
en-unannotated-03682	Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, but in comparison, flavors lacked here.
en-unannotated-03683	Overall, loves this place and the atmosphere.
en-unannotated-03684	I wasn’t disappointed.
en-unannotated-03685	Was very near to beach and walling to old town.
en-unannotated-03686	On the two occasions I've lunched here I've had really exceptional fish and seafood dishes though the meat that was served around me looked totally divine too.
en-unannotated-03687	Location was a convenient tacitly ride to the Memorial golf tournament which was why we were visiting Dublin.
en-unannotated-03688	will go back
en-unannotated-03689	We ordered the habanero wings, the bigger & corn flake chicken sandwich.
en-unannotated-03690	:) The atmosphere is nice but rather to go to a quick and good lunch than to a romantic dinner, as the locals are quite big.
en-unannotated-03691	When asked about cooking it a little bit more, we got the standard french service...
en-unannotated-03692	Seared foie and onion soup were good, though I think the onion soup has way too much cheese and the sear could have been stronger on the foie.
en-unannotated-03693	Anyone could help me please?
en-unannotated-03694	It has an unbeatable location (close to many interesting places around the city center), the terrace was superb and the service was very attentive at all our requests.
en-unannotated-03695	Rooms are nice size and very comfortable.
en-unannotated-03696	The carpet in the elevator smells and should be replaced, a bit of a turn-off coming from a 5 star hotel.
en-unannotated-03697	In closing, a truly good bar meal with a fantastic Brisbane view.
en-unannotated-03698	Located right in the center of everything.
en-unannotated-03699	Not bad, per se, but certainly not close to the best we had in Prague - the leg was on the smaller side, and the skin was a bit slimy and not particularly crispy.
en-unannotated-03700	I do recommend this hotel for the great location, facilities and customer services.
en-unannotated-03701	Rubbish doesn't work.
en-unannotated-03702	The tables are all bedecked with candelabras topped by red candles dripping wax.
en-unannotated-03703	Outrageous.
en-unannotated-03704	Pork was well cooked and I felt like after a lot of meat, I really needed that broccoli.
en-unannotated-03705	If you compare them to other similarly priced places they the answer would be an astounding yes.
en-unannotated-03706	I ordered my coffee, service was good and fast, and coffee was tasty.
en-unannotated-03707	-Best darn bagel sandwich that I have had to date!
en-unannotated-03708	What game doesn't have ads anymore unless you're willing to pay?
en-unannotated-03709	The Sicily shrimp was nothing like the picture I saw on Yelp and only came with two shrimps that were very over cooked.
en-unannotated-03710	Together they cook delicious and provide a special atmosphere when one takes out an evening to dine here.
en-unannotated-03711	My top favorite was the Weiss beer the others were excellent as well.
en-unannotated-03712	My husband got the buttermilk chicken burger.
en-unannotated-03713	Delicious and friendly place.
en-unannotated-03714	Only Spanish TV available.
en-unannotated-03715	Needs work.
en-unannotated-03716	I opted for the lamb and it was perfection.
en-unannotated-03717	the hotel itself is not 5 star anymore.
en-unannotated-03718	Nice rooms with a 5 star class service.
en-unannotated-03719	For dessert since it was my first night back in Italy I hard to give homage to the tiramisu.
en-unannotated-03720	The food was amazing!!
en-unannotated-03721	It's a good quiet romantic drink with 2... not a group.
en-unannotated-03722	Its a part of my life now everything at the touch of a button lis bn wonderful to me got me great bargains
en-unannotated-03723	No ramp for baby strollers.
en-unannotated-03724	An amazing way to drink whiskey in Ireland!
en-unannotated-03725	The location is great!
en-unannotated-03726	;)
en-unannotated-03727	I've been a fan of La Castaña for over two years and have always enjoyed the care and love they put in everything they do.
en-unannotated-03728	Great to get the week in Paris started.
en-unannotated-03729	I'll be back there for sure.
en-unannotated-03730	I've eaten there and had the Duck confit leg and it was delicious.
en-unannotated-03731	How were the Potato Dumplings, you ask?
en-unannotated-03732	and you float in that semi foggy late night to your apartment in Milano.
en-unannotated-03733	We got treated really good the service from [NAME]
en-unannotated-03734	I started with the Irish chicken wings, which were little different from American wings, save for the more sesame taste to the sauce.
en-unannotated-03735	My only reservation is the fitness room....
en-unannotated-03736	was everything.
en-unannotated-03737	After 1 day of staying we've got ants in our bags.
en-unannotated-03738	The chef is brilliant and his creations should not be missed.
en-unannotated-03739	The rooms are big and clean.
en-unannotated-03740	After finishing the game in an hour, it begs the question: what else is there to do?
en-unannotated-03741	I only had two small dishes, the something jalapeño and the seaweed salad.
en-unannotated-03742	Food amazing.
en-unannotated-03743	Furniture, design, rooms brings you closer to the history.
en-unannotated-03744	And that's fine.
en-unannotated-03745	Location and the historic building
en-unannotated-03746	5 minute walk from the Spanish steps.
en-unannotated-03747	The serving portions are gigantic but I couldn't let it go to waste.
en-unannotated-03748	People of room service didn't speak English very well so when I ordered room service often they would get my order wrong.
en-unannotated-03749	The hosts were so welcoming and knowledgeable and our other guests really helped to make this evening memorable.
en-unannotated-03750	Was tasty​, but definitely not worth 10€. Small portion and not that great.
en-unannotated-03751	Location was fabulous
en-unannotated-03752	Staff at the reception was very unfriendly at the arrival day.
en-unannotated-03753	To top it off, service was very good and the setting is truly unique.
en-unannotated-03754	Sky's TV3 Catch Up Player is far more successful.
en-unannotated-03755	Been wanting to go here for a long time.
en-unannotated-03756	and the most expensive burger is $14,50...
en-unannotated-03757	For a delicious nibble I recommend the fries, generously dusted with truffle magic.
en-unannotated-03758	The french onion soup was so good I want one just as I type this.
en-unannotated-03759	Modern place and friendly staff.
en-unannotated-03760	The meals came out sporadically not in order & were quite small for the price.
en-unannotated-03761	Noise from the bar, particularly on a Friday and Saturday night, can be a bit overpowering at times, but that is to be expected with a restaurant having an adjoining popular bar.
en-unannotated-03762	I am staying in Dublin and yelped a place to go to for dinner and this restaurant popped up as #1 so I thought I'd try it.
en-unannotated-03763	which means I have to fly back from Amsterdam but it's no problem.
en-unannotated-03764	Banana smoothie was average.
en-unannotated-03765	The restaurant has a nice ambience and a modern decoration.
en-unannotated-03766	The meal began with the amuse bouche, a warm potato and mushroom soup.
en-unannotated-03767	I mean come on!
en-unannotated-03768	The side table was dirty with someone's previously spilled drink.
en-unannotated-03769	This was the least expensive hotel in the area.
en-unannotated-03770	Get this, nuff' said!
en-unannotated-03771	Let me introduce you to what I would call my most amazing and yummy experience in Barcelona.
en-unannotated-03772	It was in some green foam like substance with mushy vegetables and flavourless prawns.
en-unannotated-03773	The portion is large, and it came with a nice salad.
en-unannotated-03774	The service was top notch.
en-unannotated-03775	As soon as we walked through the door and were welcomed by [name] and [name], we knew we would have a thoroughly enjoyable evening.
en-unannotated-03776	(I didn't notice you there!)
en-unannotated-03777	I could eat everything though but we know how the story ends.
en-unannotated-03778	Loved the fresh potato chips!
en-unannotated-03779	Excellent staff!
en-unannotated-03780	I have only positive statements regarding this hotel.
en-unannotated-03781	If you're outside of Ireland you're pretty much screwed and the app doesn't work.
en-unannotated-03782	Everything was nearby.
en-unannotated-03783	walking distance to old quarter and shopping ...
en-unannotated-03784	There's a line in the haute-cuisine-chef-movie Burnt where [NAME]'s character says, "I don't want my restaurant to be a place where people sit and eat.
en-unannotated-03785	In the shuttle on our way to go pick up our rental car, my husband and I sat next to a friendly couple who were on their second trip to Ireland and told us we had to go to the Brazen Head, the oldest pub in Dublin.
en-unannotated-03786	He is in the family that has owned the restaurant for 50+ years which only adds to the authentic and charming feel.
en-unannotated-03787	Overall it was good.
en-unannotated-03788	2 entree, 2 mains, 1 dessert and 2 glasses of wine - $150-ish.
en-unannotated-03789	The waitress literally said: Sorry but if you sit you eat.
en-unannotated-03790	Spacious and clean and secure and excellent location
en-unannotated-03791	Large portions so you will definitely fill up.
en-unannotated-03792	Quick check-in with complementary bottled water and snacks.
en-unannotated-03793	Found Tast-ller via Tripadvisor, and it was a great succes.
en-unannotated-03794	5
en-unannotated-03795	When I walked passed I wasn't sure if it was all looks no substance - I was wrong!
en-unannotated-03796	Accessories in room are a little dated.
en-unannotated-03797	For our main dishes, I got the filet de beouf with shallots, which was incomparable.
en-unannotated-03798	We could have done the chefs tasting menu all the signature tasting menu but decided a more personalised approach was better!
en-unannotated-03799	They specialize in gratin and it does not disappoint.
en-unannotated-03800	One of the best restaurants in Madrid!
en-unannotated-03801	Great location.
en-unannotated-03802	The fish was light tasty and fresh and the pumpkin side was incredible!!!
en-unannotated-03803	We heard about this because we follow Chef Taku Sekine on Instagram (of Dersou) and he heavily endorses that place (or is involved in it as it seems he was working on some taste tasting there).
en-unannotated-03804	The wifi was at times intermittent.
en-unannotated-03805	My salad was nice but the clear winner with the risotto.
en-unannotated-03806	You enjoy your meal in a very pleasant setting...
en-unannotated-03807	We started with a cabbage with sausage soup and cabbage pancakes with garlic sauce.
en-unannotated-03808	It was tender and tasty.
en-unannotated-03809	The restaurant remained open till mid night.
en-unannotated-03810	I'm in a big city and I get a couple matches a day and receive notifications of matches and messages.
en-unannotated-03811	I came across Da Oscar on yelp and thank god I did because I don't think I've had better Italian food.
en-unannotated-03812	We ordered the bruschetta to start which is always a safe and tasty starter.
en-unannotated-03813	The service was even better.
en-unannotated-03814	We had an excellent dinner of ceviche and seafood pasta.
en-unannotated-03815	I think it's just ALRIGHT, but they've got good beer and the food is not expensive at all, so while I wouldn't recommend someone come here for the food it's a nice experience to have on your trip through the town, I suppose...
en-unannotated-03816	The staffs are very helpful and friendly.
en-unannotated-03817	There are a lot of Americans eating here all the time, I mean we all read these yelp reviews.
en-unannotated-03818	The crab cakes and soup to start were good, but the cottage pie and fish pies were even better.
en-unannotated-03819	It's something that usually can only be found at small, family owned restaurants, and it helped me feel like I was welcomed into an Italian home for a heartwarming meal.
en-unannotated-03820	This place is very close to the river Liffey and within walking distance of Christ Church Cathedral.
en-unannotated-03821	Next I had the steamed prawn shumai and wagyu gyoza both hit the spot and arrived nicely after I finished my platter with the arrival of my miso soup that really warmed me up - though admittedly that could have been the sake.
en-unannotated-03822	My face on the game :( :) both don't like and like more dislike to many ads popping up in MIDDLE OF GAMEPLAY I'm deleting
en-unannotated-03823	Located approximately 20-25 mins from city center on foot.
en-unannotated-03824	We was 12 persons
en-unannotated-03825	Entertainment was okay on a Saturday night, lots of beer selections!
en-unannotated-03826	Needed parking and wanted to be near the beach, La Concha, and this place fit perfectly.
en-unannotated-03827	This is right next to out hotel and was well reviewed in yelp so on out first night we thought we would give it a try.
en-unannotated-03828	The servers were really friendly and accommodating.
en-unannotated-03829	We were very impressed with this little boutique hotel.
en-unannotated-03830	We had a variety of sushi rolls and they came out pretty fast and were delicious.
en-unannotated-03831	The place was crowded, but they got us...
en-unannotated-03832	The hot chocolate and the pastries were nice but not incredible.
en-unannotated-03833	Clearly, the Bank is a "fancy restaurant first, fancy bar second," which made it a very comfortable place to settle in for dinner and drinks.
en-unannotated-03834	So many gratins, so little time.
en-unannotated-03835	First visit " El Bazar del Sábado " which is a mexican arts and crafts market and the have a very nice...
en-unannotated-03836	Food:
en-unannotated-03837	Some people have a very inappropriate nicknames like bad words little people's names I just go with my name or someone else's or anything but.
en-unannotated-03838	I do recommend!
en-unannotated-03839	The food was absolutely outdtanding, right down to the extra delicious bottled water!
en-unannotated-03840	A boxty is an Irish potato pancake!
en-unannotated-03841	This is by far the best ice-cream place in Barcelona I have been to.
en-unannotated-03842	This was the best experience in a long time for us.
en-unannotated-03843	Okay, soundcloud as a service is pretty great.
en-unannotated-03844	We couldn't believe how great it was, especially at that price--honestly, going out for a fancy meal is usually much more expensive, and I think our total was about 87 euros (the lamb platter and four or five draft beers).
en-unannotated-03845	What is a girl to do?
en-unannotated-03846	Overall, though, I wouldn't call this place a tourist trap - the food prices are reasonable, the quality is decent for this area, but overall it's just not a great restaurant.
en-unannotated-03847	The waiter saw me looking at my map, and came over to provide directions.
en-unannotated-03848	Just wow!
en-unannotated-03849	I think it's because it's doesn't have a lot of taste to it.
en-unannotated-03850	While my experience with 'gastronomic' restaurants in Paris is not very large (over the years let's say that I've only been to a handful), I'd be surprised if you can find better culinary value for money than at Aspic.
en-unannotated-03851	It's one of the most beautiful restaurants I've ever seen!
en-unannotated-03852	However, the girl manning the bar and also serving all the tables was so friendly and understanding and also spoke English very well.
en-unannotated-03853	Underground, dim lighting, rich tasty dishes, well stocked bar, check check check.
en-unannotated-03854	And they serve a fat garlic piece of the bread (to rub on the bread fyi), which I haven't seen done since Italy.
en-unannotated-03855	Located outside the city centre, close to a number of office towers, including my own company.
en-unannotated-03856	The inside of the restaurant is very nice and the beers on tap are pretty affordable compared to restaurants/bars in the Temple Bar Area.
en-unannotated-03857	Its annoying to see the same snap 5 times just to see their new one.
en-unannotated-03858	20 min later she got us outdoor seating, which we thought was better than the bar to people watch.
en-unannotated-03859	The hot chocolates and pieces of cakes...
en-unannotated-03860	We strongly recommend, one if the refreshing place we visited on our trip to Italy.
en-unannotated-03861	I take the most joy from it by killing worms larger than me.
en-unannotated-03862	Very laid back and friendly.
en-unannotated-03863	Otherwise, this is...
en-unannotated-03864	We spent one night in Bogota and really enjoyed our stay in this hotel.
en-unannotated-03865	Food good, atmosphere is great
en-unannotated-03866	:( Duck ravioli was awesome!
en-unannotated-03867	I'm super keen to get back to Black Bird - the only tough decision will be whether to try something new or get that delicious duck again!
en-unannotated-03868	We were cosseted from the moment of arrival by the wonderfully attentive staff.
en-unannotated-03869	The small dining room is down a short flight of stairs with...
en-unannotated-03870	
en-unannotated-03871	So whatever your night out maybe, dinner at the restaurant or drinks at the bar, you will be in awe at the magnificence of Blackbird, whilst at the same time feeling like you totally belong & deserve it!
en-unannotated-03872	It was packed so expect to share a table for dinner but you can reserve to.
en-unannotated-03873	Easy to use.
en-unannotated-03874	Totally recommend
en-unannotated-03875	After a long transatlantic flight I was picked up by the Hotel's driver (super nice and efficient) and arrived shortly after in the hotel.
en-unannotated-03876	Is there a way to challenge friends in 9ball though?
en-unannotated-03877	The only things this place has going for it is nice decor and it's proximity to the Milan Cathedral.
en-unannotated-03878	Located near Parque 93 which is a great area for going out for dinner.
en-unannotated-03879	Both had a lot of flavor and for what we paid, they were a bargain!
en-unannotated-03880	It is a very nice hotel located in a monumental building.
en-unannotated-03881	Our rooms were beautiful, with attention abundantly paid, to all the details I love.
en-unannotated-03882	I used the saver rate by booking in advance.
en-unannotated-03883	He continued to ignore us after several times of trying to get his attention- very rude.
en-unannotated-03884	Check-in and check-out time was fast.
en-unannotated-03885	At present not providing snacks evening time.
en-unannotated-03886	Angelo and a further 10 from the Vatican.
en-unannotated-03887	This place was fantastic and everything we had was prepared perfectly.
en-unannotated-03888	What a great last night in Italia.
en-unannotated-03889	Had a great 2 night stay here.
en-unannotated-03890	Excellent flavours and a sizeable serving of prawns.
en-unannotated-03891	Food was cooked to perfection, my Calamari salad was not only brimming with calamari, it also was full of flavour!
en-unannotated-03892	I can't say enough about this place.
en-unannotated-03893	The staff was excellent, very friendly and helpful.
en-unannotated-03894	My friend had the tostadas, which were also pretty good and had a twist to them!
en-unannotated-03895	Providing a bit of creative flair, the waiter poured the coffee syrup through a filter on top of the pannacotta at the table.
en-unannotated-03896	Do the same if you can.
en-unannotated-03897	Both were enough for me and my husband to share....
en-unannotated-03898	Overall I loved my meal at Miel Burger and definitely consider it one of the best in Brisbane, especially if you're looking for something a bit more interesting and different to a classic cheeseburger.
en-unannotated-03899	They were extremely friendly, spoke fluent English, and accommodated my partners gluten and dairy food allergies.
en-unannotated-03900	A big group of us stayed here as part of a family reunion and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
en-unannotated-03901	The building was very centrally located -- perfect if you only have a short stay in Rome.
en-unannotated-03902	be hungry when you get the burger.
en-unannotated-03903	I live nearby this little café and passed it once on my way home, and decided I had to come back with my friends.
en-unannotated-03904	It is a counter-service place with self-seating, and people are constantly fighting over tables.
en-unannotated-03905	All was wonderful.
en-unannotated-03906	Fantastic food, prepared with great attention to detail.
en-unannotated-03907	They brew two lagers, a red, and a dark beer.
en-unannotated-03908	Although slightly busy, the food came out quickly.
en-unannotated-03909	I cannot say enough about the restaurants, service and overall feel of the this beautiful hacienda sytle hotel.
en-unannotated-03910	I have to say the fish mains that we ordered were pretty standard, not out of this world but good so there is room to really impress me there:)
en-unannotated-03911	Good service, but maybe they must learn to wait, that You have finnised before they serve the next meal.
en-unannotated-03912	Looking over the menu pleased to find the Czech food we were looking for.
en-unannotated-03913	Walked in stood for 15 minutes, nobody offered to help.
en-unannotated-03914	No reservations when we sauntered in with me fearing that the place was going to be a rip-off as it was right off the main square.
en-unannotated-03915	Run by a charming couple.
en-unannotated-03916	Dip fries in it?
en-unannotated-03917	Staff was very nice and provided great advice both for food and for wine.
en-unannotated-03918	The duck leg was underwhelming.
en-unannotated-03919	I will have to go.
en-unannotated-03920	We ordered the beer goulash and the kids ribs.
en-unannotated-03921	For instance when I was playing 9 Ball pool in Dallas it would NOT let me tap to call a pocket.
en-unannotated-03922	The place was quite busy around 7pm, so get in early if you don't want to wait long for your food.
en-unannotated-03923	Location, location, location!
en-unannotated-03924	We were greeted by the daughter of the owner, lovely woman, helpful with a big smile.
en-unannotated-03925	Great starters!
en-unannotated-03926	I was stuffed!
en-unannotated-03927	I will say the white chocolate mousse was my favorite out of these two, but both were remarkable.
en-unannotated-03928	It was a great experience for [name] and [name] to welcome us into their lovely home and share with us a traditional Catalan meal....
en-unannotated-03929	The creme brûlée was also perfectly sweet.
en-unannotated-03930	***For those wanting to make theirs faster watch the ad then go like your going to spin then go back and watch another ad.
en-unannotated-03931	The ingredients are fresh, the menu inspired, the wait staff is attentive, helpful and gracious.
en-unannotated-03932	The CBD MiEL Burger is the bomb- really cute, food is great AND affordable.
en-unannotated-03933	Recommend going further into the inside restaurant as the interior is quite cute.
en-unannotated-03934	Really rich and creamy, and pipping HOT!
en-unannotated-03935	But the food here was average.
en-unannotated-03936	I had a Brazilian and then a Columbian coffee.
en-unannotated-03937	The app is getting worse as the time pases, a few ago it wasn't so hard to get a match and at least I could see how many likes I had left...
en-unannotated-03938	The...
en-unannotated-03939	I am glad I did not make the extra trip here for dinner.
en-unannotated-03940	Bonus ;)
en-unannotated-03941	I will probably never eat another meal as satisfying as this one.
en-unannotated-03942	But one cannot eat every meal at the Hard Rock Cafe, regretfully, so you must persevere.
en-unannotated-03943	fantastic.
en-unannotated-03944	I got the Bastion red wine and the scallops risotto.
en-unannotated-03945	I felt like I walked into the movie hocus pocus (it was also October and 3 days away from Halloween). There is a cobblestone pathway that leads to the patio outside the pub.
en-unannotated-03946	Another good stay at the Hospes Madrid, this time for my partner’s birthday.
en-unannotated-03947	You can even make your own - for a VERY reasonable price!!
en-unannotated-03948	I ordered the Strawberries and cream, served with meringue, sorbet and rhubarb purée.
en-unannotated-03949	I'm in Madrid by myself until the weekend, and found this little place on Trip Advisor, as it is located only about 100m from my hotel.
en-unannotated-03950	Easy to use
en-unannotated-03951	To my disappointment, the menu had change and it was not available (I ended up getting the rabbit leg). Likewise, some of the menu items get sold out which seem to indicate that they serve all their ingredients fresh and try not to overstock.
en-unannotated-03952	Go just for those.
en-unannotated-03953	The bar is open until late time which permits to prolong your conversations and talks with friends and colleagues after dinner.
en-unannotated-03954	- Uneven, broken/cracking metal bed frame;
en-unannotated-03955	I loved the sound of the apple wood smoked duck breast with caramelised carrots, chestnuts and confit leg stuffed cabbage ($34) so ordered that.
en-unannotated-03956	The rooms, the bathrooms, the beds were always clean.
en-unannotated-03957	Hailo was 100 times better.
en-unannotated-03958	Considering the classy fit out, & priceless views, the price points are surprisingly accessible.
en-unannotated-03959	Very simple in my opinion.
en-unannotated-03960	We came early for lunch on a Sunday, around 2, and only waited about ten minutes for a table.
en-unannotated-03961	One small complaint - the sauce for the meatballs was too rich and creamy (and too much of it).
en-unannotated-03962	They had a nice selection for breakfast.
en-unannotated-03963	This venue is quite nice on Eagle Street Pier.
en-unannotated-03964	Always have time for a hello and always bring me water.
en-unannotated-03965	The people are super friendly and fun and the food, served family style, was amazing.
en-unannotated-03966	İt was an horrible experience for a hotel.
en-unannotated-03967	Relatively quiet (with earplugs). Clean.
en-unannotated-03968	We have been many times, but this experience was over the top.
en-unannotated-03969	The staff is very friendly and helped w/ any questions we had.
en-unannotated-03970	This location is characterized by its long wooden hallway.
en-unannotated-03971	i prefer their breakfast options.
en-unannotated-03972	Simple.
en-unannotated-03973	Went to Paris over the summer and tried this place it was great.
en-unannotated-03974	I was stuffed but had to finish it.
en-unannotated-03975	Service of personnel is very good.
en-unannotated-03976	This is of course away from the madness of the duomo or navigli- not quite the burbs but a hike from vittorio emanuelle-- yeah that grand covered mall.
en-unannotated-03977	We ordered simple menu items: muesli and a bagel but by the time 45 mins had elapsed, and the majority of customers had left, we were still sitting waiting for our food.
en-unannotated-03978	It's a small restaurant with a small staff, but our waiter was incredibly helpful in explaining the menu since we don't speak Italian.
en-unannotated-03979	Old world elegence and central location.
en-unannotated-03980	This fine local eatery was packed with regulars/locals.
en-unannotated-03981	You walk in and you are under a covered patio where the cool breeze comes in.
en-unannotated-03982	The service and the host are always very friendly and welcoming.
en-unannotated-03983	My husband had some breathing difficulties during our visit and the hotel staff had a doctor in our room at 6 am.
en-unannotated-03984	In April we spent two nights at the Maria Cristina while traveling in northern Spain on a Tauck tour.
en-unannotated-03985	There's only one beer, but it's a pretty decent one, and it's from a self-serve tap.
en-unannotated-03986	The restaurant is good and we were served a delicious meat.
en-unannotated-03987	Listen..
en-unannotated-03988	It may not be everyones first preference, but if it was gone it would be surely missed.
en-unannotated-03989	Outstanding food and a wonderful experience.
en-unannotated-03990	The location, the staff, the lobby bar.
en-unannotated-03991	Try the cocktail bar next door, would be worth the wait.
en-unannotated-03992	We are coming back for a second night before we leave Milano.
en-unannotated-03993	Upgrade and fruits/sweets in the room.
en-unannotated-03994	The waiters had smiles on their faces and seemed so much more relaxed and friendly than the ones at Kožná.
en-unannotated-03995	I happened to go to Cafe Pushkin when they were celebrating his birthday so got given a choice of a free glass of champagne or vodka- what a nice surprise and start to my dinner!
en-unannotated-03996	Can't login error.
en-unannotated-03997	Words can't describe how much we fell in love with this place!
en-unannotated-03998	So you're in Prague skip the touristy restaurants on the Square and try U Tri Ruzi.
en-unannotated-03999	Huge balcony.
en-unannotated-04000	I have been have dinner in this place for three years, the same that I have living in Mexico City, for an special ocassion or just to have a great moment this restaurant is the perfect option.
en-unannotated-04001	Large comfortable, modern apartment.
en-unannotated-04002	The hotel is a real hidden gem with great staff, excellent attention for detail and it is fantastic value for money.
en-unannotated-04003	Everything was delicious.
en-unannotated-04004	I came here after taking an Uber from the Guinness Storehouse.
en-unannotated-04005	The only time our waiter (an older gentleman) came to our table was to ask us if we wanted another beer.
en-unannotated-04006	Great flat whites too.
en-unannotated-04007	Best game in the whole world but it has a very short time to unlock new characters do something about it plz.
en-unannotated-04008	He was wonderful.
en-unannotated-04009	Every pure juice is 100% real, so very fresh.
en-unannotated-04010	Winner!
en-unannotated-04011	We had the set menu and although the quality of the food was good, it seemed to take forever to come out.
en-unannotated-04012	150% good.
en-unannotated-04013	This place is located in the Temple bar area, which is usually crowded, but it's with coming down to try these spud delights.
en-unannotated-04014	Nice hotel with friendly staff - all spoke English.
en-unannotated-04015	Was certainly worth the 20 min wait to get a table
en-unannotated-04016	The location is excellent and convenient for walking to all the sites.
en-unannotated-04017	The fresh...
en-unannotated-04018	My husband's favorite Italian dish is cacio e pepe.
en-unannotated-04019	The only criticism I have for "Brew" is that we waited over 45 minutes for our food which to me is ridiculous when it's smashed avocado on toast with bacon...
en-unannotated-04020	Ignore all the good reviews because you actaully have to pay to listen to all these songs.
en-unannotated-04021	Not much offering on room service, Bathroom was dusty an old.
en-unannotated-04022	Having recently dined at Blackbird bar & grill, it is now one of our favourites for elegant dining, with amazing sweeping views to match of the Brisbane River & Story Bridge.
en-unannotated-04023	Yum yum yuM!!!!!!
en-unannotated-04024	They told us if we weren't already wanting something else, we should consider the Gratin.
en-unannotated-04025	If you have not been then go!
en-unannotated-04026	I had the soft shell crab entree and then barramundi with a bunch of different sides and it couldn't have been better.
en-unannotated-04027	And yes they serve hoards of people every day but......
en-unannotated-04028	She said that it would take 10 minutes to prepare and was well worth it.
en-unannotated-04029	We went there because of the good reviews on tripadvisor.
en-unannotated-04030	It was AMAZING.
en-unannotated-04031	After the pint is finished outside, I try to go inside to have a piss and get more pints, where he stops me saying: you're not going to enter, you stepped on me!!
en-unannotated-04032	Food: amazing
en-unannotated-04033	After a discussion of how it was prepared, I ordered the pied de cochon (pigs feet), and the veal kidneys, cooked medium.
en-unannotated-04034	But not flexible with dietary restrictions
en-unannotated-04035	And the dinner was outstanding.
en-unannotated-04036	The mushroom chips were probably my favorite part of our visit.
en-unannotated-04037	Based on previous reviews I decided to check this place out.
en-unannotated-04038	The Asian salad and burger were both outstanding...
en-unannotated-04039	Hotel provides guests with a smartphone with many useful features for tourists in Rome and free international calls!
en-unannotated-04040	Provide the internet connection with high bandwidth.
en-unannotated-04041	My bill, which included a glass of wine and sparkling water, came out to less than €40. I warmly recommend you try this gem of a restaurant.
en-unannotated-04042	It was good but it wasn't as Japanese in the menu choices as I would have liked.
en-unannotated-04043	The result that came out of the kitchen was excellent.
en-unannotated-04044	This was certainly not my first stay at this property, nor is it my first review.
en-unannotated-04045	Book ahead if you can.
en-unannotated-04046	perfect!
en-unannotated-04047	That was a welcome surprise.
en-unannotated-04048	Came here on a really cold day and was greeted instantly by the nicest bartender/waiter.
en-unannotated-04049	They have a wonderful early bird special, but I was late.
en-unannotated-04050	Yep, you can get grilled vegies done to perfection.
en-unannotated-04051	Total for two glasses of Viognier, two starters, two mains, one dessert= 82,00€ in April of 2017.
en-unannotated-04052	Room was changed and I moved into a nice room, with internet....
en-unannotated-04053	I can't begin to explain just how much I love this place, from the friendly and accommodating staff that aren't afraid to have a personality to the perfectly executed non-pretentious delicious real food.
en-unannotated-04054	The mussels were accompanied by a sauce that was unreal, and I ate the entire huge slice of bread, taking advantage of it as a sauce delivery system.
en-unannotated-04055	They make to order and let you choose the ingredients.
en-unannotated-04056	Even if the prices are a bit expensive, you can only appreciate it.
en-unannotated-04057	Wen took the little tour term and he stopped at restaurant per our request.
en-unannotated-04058	Extremely comfortable rooms - Housekeeping was SUPERB.
en-unannotated-04059	They serve organic free-range food, and most of the things on their menu is on the healthy side, as well as being really tasty!
en-unannotated-04060	Such good food but so painfully full.
en-unannotated-04061	It really lived up to the reputation of Sake as a contemporary Japanese restaurant because while using traditional flavours, Sake put its own twist on it!
en-unannotated-04062	- Toilet constantly running & making noise;
en-unannotated-04063	The space isn't massive, and at the time I went there were no free bar stools, so I had my coffee to go.
en-unannotated-04064	In addition to the design your own burger, you have the option of some pre designed hits like miso pork belly.
en-unannotated-04065	Price was high so food was not matching with the price.
en-unannotated-04066	Geared towards international guests, this restaurant has the menu...
en-unannotated-04067	The dish was pitch black, was not pleasing to look at, on the salter side and it made our mouth and teeth dye black from the squid ink or food coloring.
en-unannotated-04068	We both had the burgher with chips.
en-unannotated-04069	We ordered the Porc Mijote (kind of like a curry) and the Lamb (kind of like kho if you are familiar with Vietnamese cuisine, or caramelized sauce) and both were SOOO good...
en-unannotated-04070	It is not just about the food.
en-unannotated-04071	Service was really friendly and prices were decent!
en-unannotated-04072	The burger was cooked perfectly.
en-unannotated-04073	However, I decided to try the Spicy Chorizo Gnocchi on Verve's menu.
en-unannotated-04074	Honestly it's some of the best Italian good you can get!
en-unannotated-04075	It is small and when you reserve a table it is yours.
en-unannotated-04076	My husband and I were searching for a great last meal in Paris and found this place on Yelp.
en-unannotated-04077	A Jekyll and Hyde experience -- went twice on the same day.
en-unannotated-04078	Delicious, beautiful.
en-unannotated-04079	A welcome drink would have been more than...
en-unannotated-04080	They have a large variety of flavours and I bet each and every one tastes amazing.
en-unannotated-04081	This place a definitely one of the best steakhouse in Moscow.
en-unannotated-04082	We wanted a simple quick dinner, and this was perfect.
en-unannotated-04083	On a student's budget, this place is definitely on the pricey side, with their scallop risotto costing about 23 euros.
en-unannotated-04084	4. une bouteille de vin (a bottle of wine, but of course)
en-unannotated-04085	Just a heads up, this isn't your average restaurant where the waiter checks on you and brings over your check.
en-unannotated-04086	Old fashioned with soft springs which sink when you sleep.
en-unannotated-04087	We visited Monsieur Benjamin by incidence, but it was absolutely worth it!
en-unannotated-04088	The fat was beautifully rendered but the outer surface was crisped just right.
en-unannotated-04089	I highly recommend either making a reservation or coming early or as a small group because even though the place is mega long it fills up very quickly with locals and you maybe need to wait an hour to sit but not to worry you can still have beers at the counters while waiting.
en-unannotated-04090	If you're looking for a hotel with free parking lovely airy clean rooms and very friendly and helpful staff this the hotel to stay at.
en-unannotated-04091	New hotel, very clean and modern.
en-unannotated-04092	Having a Sake in Sydney and yet, not having visited it, I thought 'Yeah, you are SO right!
en-unannotated-04093	It is expensive for what you get.
en-unannotated-04094	I loved this meal so much and it was the perfect cap to a perfect vacation.
en-unannotated-04095	Meat everywhere!
en-unannotated-04096	Top 10 pork dishes I've ever had.
en-unannotated-04097	I potted a ball but again it came on table....
en-unannotated-04098	The pancakes are kind of mushy but they work.
en-unannotated-04099	They were tender and had a lot of flavor to them.
en-unannotated-04100	The entire experience makes you feel like in an Italian Pizzeria.
en-unannotated-04101	I really liked this restaurant.
en-unannotated-04102	Now that that's out of the way, go enjoy a traditional Czech meal!
en-unannotated-04103	Everything was awesome and getting to meet new people over a meal was very cool and out of the box.
en-unannotated-04104	This place is fine if you are in your 20's and travelling around Europe.
en-unannotated-04105	In addition, we were given breakfast, which we had not included.
en-unannotated-04106	I had a great stay at the hotel.
en-unannotated-04107	And although not generally a fan of pineapple on my burgers, I have to say that thick slice of grilled sweetness made that burger!
en-unannotated-04108	The restaurant is decorated from the 60's.
en-unannotated-04109	[name] was our server and he was excellent.
en-unannotated-04110	They have a lot of cool, unique pancake options.
en-unannotated-04111	My partner had the breakfast, which comes with this fantastic home made tomato sauce.
en-unannotated-04112	For the price, you'll be very hard pressed to find better in that part of Rome.
en-unannotated-04113	I noticed that many other diners ordered the same combination of appetizer and first course.
en-unannotated-04114	Food is absolutely amazing and atmosphere is relaxed.
en-unannotated-04115	The oldest pub in Ireland so I had to try it.
en-unannotated-04116	Add TWO big onion rings for only $2! There are salads too, gluten free options and they are flexible with the changes you can make and do it all with a big smile.
en-unannotated-04117	The chocolate cake is a classic here, it is flourless and rich!
en-unannotated-04118	The room was modern and very clean.
en-unannotated-04119	We stayed at the Parma Hotel in 2003 and enjoyed it, so thought we would stay here again and we weren’t disappointed!
en-unannotated-04120	The breakfast buffet is ample and delicious.
en-unannotated-04121	Plenty of options for all types plus they make awesome coffee.
en-unannotated-04122	All hail the steak tartare and meatloaf.
en-unannotated-04123	-Spicy beef sausage
en-unannotated-04124	As a family room it was cramped and hot.
en-unannotated-04125	also a great place to entertain in Santa Fe.
en-unannotated-04126	As an after thought, he said, oh and we have pigs feet for an appetizer.
en-unannotated-04127	This made me really confused since she didn't bother to ask us for a name and there were dozens of other people at the bar.
en-unannotated-04128	This was our second visit.
en-unannotated-04129	You should definitely try this ice cream.
en-unannotated-04130	Prices are very low considering the quality.
en-unannotated-04131	On this visit I ordered the popcorn shrimp, wagyu new-style with ginger, chives and yuzu soy, yellowfin tuna belly with edamame & jalapeño purée, sautéed shiitake mushrooms, asparagus spears and nori dressing and steamed prawn dumplings with spicy ponzu.
en-unannotated-04132	the ambiance is lovely, great decor and music, and good energy.
en-unannotated-04133	Fran made sure that I was taken care of and engaged in the perfect amount of conversation through out the meal.
en-unannotated-04134	Washed my clothing and the stains didn't come out...
en-unannotated-04135	-A variety of vegan and gluten free options
en-unannotated-04136	The staff couldn't be nicer and more helpful, especially [name] and [name].
en-unannotated-04137	Waiting staff was super friendly ([NAME] even gave me recommendations on what to do in town), beer was good and cheap and food was delicious!
en-unannotated-04138	The main dining room has a very 1920s-style fit out, from the decorative print on the windows, carpet and seats to the extravagant lighting fixture in the centre.
en-unannotated-04139	Great pub that plays great music!
en-unannotated-04140	Came here just to try coffee because it had good reviews.
en-unannotated-04141	I booked a reservation on The Fork for lunch.
en-unannotated-04142	There are so many levels and it is the perfect amount of challenging and addictive.
en-unannotated-04143	Drivers often cancelling orders and you should enter origin and destination againg, price always higher than estimate in app
en-unannotated-04144	Up the hill, towards the sights.
en-unannotated-04145	I can't say that this would be my favorite dessert from now on but it was enjoyable nonetheless.
en-unannotated-04146	I later found out that he owned the restaurant with his brother.
en-unannotated-04147	The staff was friendly and the service was good.
en-unannotated-04148	Great location in the middel of the long beach, justine block back.
en-unannotated-04149	Our way through Italy.
en-unannotated-04150	The shower literally fell on my head and while I was walking in the room a piece of wood got stuck into my socks!!
en-unannotated-04151	Loved the dry soup, and my steak was cooked to PERFECTION!!!
en-unannotated-04152	There are many other highly recommended restaurants but this is a restaurant I would regret not visiting if I come back to Paris.
en-unannotated-04153	4 stars!
en-unannotated-04154	The roll I picked (a variety was provided) was olive bread and was warm with a crunchy crust and the butter was amazing - do NOT skip the bread!
en-unannotated-04155	It's a good sign then when your table shuts up because the food is that good, that one must savour each bite & remember the feeling at that moment.
en-unannotated-04156	Life requires balance.
en-unannotated-04157	Candle lit charm makes P Mac's best after dark.
en-unannotated-04158	Food and services were great.
en-unannotated-04159	i lost 3M due to this.
en-unannotated-04160	It'll be a while before that's really true, but in the meantime, go find this place.
en-unannotated-04161	Lovey interior and good service despite it being very busy.
en-unannotated-04162	Chocolate cake: This was standard.
en-unannotated-04163	give you 5 star in all format but for the last version not for these latest version you have to improve bugs because in some matches when i played a match of 10 k it started 2.5 k match or sometimes 500 hundred match u should improve these and add one 5k match also this is the request from me     Regards : shahbaz shaikh
en-unannotated-04164	The room is outdated, the pillows n the spring bed are too old, the decor should be improved ..
en-unannotated-04165	And it was delicious and worth every czech kroner.
en-unannotated-04166	Only 20 people can fit inside so make sure to request reservations.
en-unannotated-04167	I had the shrimp and avocado appetizer with another item called "moment of patience."
en-unannotated-04168	We were hoping for something great but my cappuccino tasted funny.
en-unannotated-04169	Was pretty empty when we went (during the day).
en-unannotated-04170	The staff was nice, but...
en-unannotated-04171	Excellent service.
en-unannotated-04172	And for breakfast they were nice enough to create something for me that wasn't even on the menu.
en-unannotated-04173	30 minutes of anticipation and patient testing wait later I finally got it.
en-unannotated-04174	With a broad variety of pizzas that they sell by the slice at 2,5€, this is undoubtedly one of the best value for money places for a quick takeaway.
en-unannotated-04175	I love the new update but it has a bugs in it.
en-unannotated-04176	I stayed in "Jeff Bridges", a single room on the top floor, and it was great.
en-unannotated-04177	I like the bit where people sell stuff.
en-unannotated-04178	We stayed here for five nights, chosen from reviews on TA.
en-unannotated-04179	When we walked out we saw more of grins on the chalkboard that we did not see anywhere inside maybe that's how it's done.
en-unannotated-04180	We went twice.
en-unannotated-04181	!...
en-unannotated-04182	) The guys were sweet, with enough English to get by.
en-unannotated-04183	(Had quite a few by now)
en-unannotated-04184	Dinner is a little expensive but not overly so.
en-unannotated-04185	I ordered foie gras, which I have never eaten before, and felt torn between animal cruelty and curiosity in tasting it.
en-unannotated-04186	I stayed with my wife in rooms 215 and the larger appointed 310. Rooms are very appointed - traditional Latin feel.
en-unannotated-04187	The risotto is ok.
en-unannotated-04188	On the first page of course.
en-unannotated-04189	Service not particularly friendly or helpful.
en-unannotated-04190	Then beef carpaccio with shaved pecorino and grapefruit.
en-unannotated-04191	Stayed here for a couple of nights as I wanted to explore a different part of the city.
en-unannotated-04192	Too expensive for the quality provided.
en-unannotated-04193	This place is not only beautiful, the food is incredible!
en-unannotated-04194	Funkiest rectangular box I've ever set foot in.
en-unannotated-04195	the design concept and common area is nice as well.
en-unannotated-04196	The bruschetta and both pastas we ordered were delicious.
en-unannotated-04197	The room was clean and comfortable.
en-unannotated-04198	Do recommend for a nice cup of tea/coffee and a snack.
en-unannotated-04199	Miel also have a Classic Burger menu with some interesting options like the Miso Smoked Pork Belly and Korean BBQ Bulgogi burgers.
en-unannotated-04200	Change of plans...
en-unannotated-04201	The steak du poivre and salmon are also excellent entrees.
en-unannotated-04202	I was surprised because I've heard horror stories.
en-unannotated-04203	Because it is small in there you may have to wait for a table, but thankfully there is a little bar that you can wait at.
en-unannotated-04204	The quality and freshness of the food was apparent and everything was meticulously prepared.
en-unannotated-04205	We started with potato croquettes and cabbage pancakes with a side of Garlic sauce (SO GOOD)... I then had the highly recommended Beer goulash in bread bowl.
en-unannotated-04206	And great agua de horchata!
en-unannotated-04207	Small lunch menu but definitely enjoyed the options!!
en-unannotated-04208	Experience ruined by excessive ads.
en-unannotated-04209	you catch my drift.
en-unannotated-04210	Good: clean, relatively new
en-unannotated-04211	Visually stunning in a non conformist, industrial, hipster chic way.
en-unannotated-04212	My favourite was the tropical one!
en-unannotated-04213	This wasn't just the best meal I have ever...
en-unannotated-04214	Prices are high for what you get.
en-unannotated-04215	I mean don't get me wrong it isn't bad and their coconut tapioca could very well be one of Mexico City's best desserts but definitely you can find better cebiches and seafood dishes elsewhere.
en-unannotated-04216	First impressions count and the staff plus the reception area are very impressive.
en-unannotated-04217	This review has been my worst written review with grammatically incorrect English.
en-unannotated-04218	Glad we did.
en-unannotated-04219	To say the least.
en-unannotated-04220	I was impressed this place is so highly ranked.
en-unannotated-04221	That was incredibly helpful for mapping, restaurant searches, and signing up for tours.
en-unannotated-04222	We then moved into our main dish which was Pasta alla Norma and Risotto Milanese.
en-unannotated-04223	and the service was...
en-unannotated-04224	Is this some sick joke?
en-unannotated-04225	We tried everything and we were very impressed.
en-unannotated-04226	Great service, original concept and explosive flavors will make you feel right in heaven.
en-unannotated-04227	To finish, we shared sticky date cake and the vietnamese pannacotta.
en-unannotated-04228	Other reviewers noted that it is not an international-level hotel.
en-unannotated-04229	I also enjoyed a classic old fashion.
en-unannotated-04230	But the nickel and dime-ing got on my last nerve.
en-unannotated-04231	The food was beautifully presented, each dish explained in detail in excellent English.
en-unannotated-04232	hop on and hop off stop just out side the hotel.
en-unannotated-04233	Fantastic presentation.
en-unannotated-04234	Our waitress was very helpful, attentive, and happy !
en-unannotated-04235	Loly is not only a remarkable chef, but a remarkable spirit.
en-unannotated-04236	We will be missing the gratin in New York!
en-unannotated-04237	Wifi is not working
en-unannotated-04238	Perfect service performance and always kind, friendly and very effective.
en-unannotated-04239	Gnocchi or not, please please get the Oscar sauce with any pasta.
en-unannotated-04240	On arrival they promptly told us check in was at 3pm and we had to come back on check out day to see if we could arrange a late check out.
en-unannotated-04241	Maybe if you could connect to Facebook and play to get a higher score than your friends would make it better to.
en-unannotated-04242	Please fix.
en-unannotated-04243	TV was large.
en-unannotated-04244	We came for lunch and chose the 'Market Menu' which is basically 3...
en-unannotated-04245	Let's get this out of the way - the food was fantastic.
en-unannotated-04246	Great attention!
en-unannotated-04247	The scallop and salmon sushi was chewy and very uneven portion sizing (which isn't an issue just odd as sushi is usually so precise and presentation is usually much better). The Chocolate cake with Berry sorbet was particularly good though and worth mentioning!
en-unannotated-04248	The food here is fresh and tasty!
en-unannotated-04249	The flavours of the meal combined perfectly and I savoured every bite!
en-unannotated-04250	Since it was a lovely summer evening we had dinner outside on the...
en-unannotated-04251	But I think it's time to uninstall.
en-unannotated-04252	I tired the sashimi platter with 18 pieces of mixed seafood and absolutely enjoyed everything about it, there was a great variety of fish and couple of marinated bites.
en-unannotated-04253	Chilled atmosphere, good food, populated by mostly inoffensive locals and staff who always love to have a laugh - it's easy to find that you've been there for hours without noticing.
en-unannotated-04254	Even if you're lucky enough to get one, you can expect another party to hover over you the whole time you are eating, waiting to swoop in when you leave.
en-unannotated-04255	Plus you can't beat the atmosphere on a chilly night!
en-unannotated-04256	You can see that the waiters are stressed and pressured to turn over tables.
en-unannotated-04257	
en-unannotated-04258	Looks like nothing from the outside, but it's inside it's very beautiful.
en-unannotated-04259	Small place with great local food, a must at Bogota.
en-unannotated-04260	A crowded place in a beautiful area of Mexico city, but a Mexican food place that worth it.
en-unannotated-04261	Great tamales.
en-unannotated-04262	All else are quite old and dated, so comfort level is not quite there.
en-unannotated-04263	This was my favorite dinner of restaurants we went to in Prague.
en-unannotated-04264	Rome is always fully booked in weekends no way.
en-unannotated-04265	Our waiter was very professional, always had a smile on his face, had excellent meal and wine recommendations, and was more than happy to communicate in English.
en-unannotated-04266	It was very busy in the evenings so...
en-unannotated-04267	It's that good!
en-unannotated-04268	Excellent food and service, will definitely go into my Top-3 foodexperince.
en-unannotated-04269	- Gloom hospital style corridor (3rd floor);
en-unannotated-04270	We had an amazing meal, we had a selection of starters, from shrimps to caviar with quale eggs and chopped shallots.
en-unannotated-04271	Many thanks and appreciation to the shift led by mr.
en-unannotated-04272	The staff are efficient, friendly and helpful.
en-unannotated-04273	We didnt have a reservation but they seated us right away.
en-unannotated-04274	overpriced tasteless food, the food is not great is expensive and they take long time to serve, there are many great options around..
en-unannotated-04275	I stayed at the NH Hacienda Royal Hotel in Bogota for 4 nights In March/April 2017 while I was there on business.
en-unannotated-04276	I really want to like this place more but unfortunately, it was too hectic and I wasn't a fan of the limited seating.
en-unannotated-04277	Order the house red, an unbelievable Cote de Rhone!!
en-unannotated-04278	The location is fine and has some restaurants within walking distance.
en-unannotated-04279	These were so crispy and yummy!
en-unannotated-04280	Had no idea what we were really ordering as all in Spanish and we are ignorant English.
en-unannotated-04281	Staff is very kind and helpful.
en-unannotated-04282	We went with the GSM, unfortunately another group ordered the last bottles so we went with another vineyards option and it delightful, Kaesler Avignon, much smoother.
en-unannotated-04283	Yum!
en-unannotated-04284	Pay a visit.
en-unannotated-04285	We had to wait 10 minutes at meantime to get a table.
en-unannotated-04286	One of the first restaurants when I went to Prague in June!
en-unannotated-04287	too much and too dry.
en-unannotated-04288	Beds are a bit hard but better than too soft.
en-unannotated-04289	Old, small bathroom
en-unannotated-04290	Breakfast selection not as good as other hotels, but adequate.
en-unannotated-04291	Please sort these glitches out and it will be a great game.
en-unannotated-04292	The waiter chose a Mexican Cabernet Merlot for me, which was as good as any...
en-unannotated-04293	This definitely had the NY/DC feel of being a small restaurant where you would need reservations months in advance because the seating was so limited and the food is so good.
en-unannotated-04294	Finally we decided to try it for our anniversary dinner.
en-unannotated-04295	I am loving Milan.
en-unannotated-04296	The tables have cute decorations and we really wanted to sit at the barrel table but unfortunately it was in the area without service.
en-unannotated-04297	Service overall was very good and staff was friendly.
en-unannotated-04298	We stayed here for one night.
en-unannotated-04299	here's the thing.....
en-unannotated-04300	First, this place is TINY.
en-unannotated-04301	I could have eaten 20 of them easy, unbelievable flavor and decadently rich.
en-unannotated-04302	Location and the fact that it had two bathrooms with showers.
en-unannotated-04303	Florida, New Hampshire, Zimbabwe, Siberia, (or Syria, I forget), Brazil & NY.
en-unannotated-04304	Top 3:
en-unannotated-04305	selecting the fried pork leg schnitzel plus a side potato salad.
en-unannotated-04306	I would definitely...
en-unannotated-04307	Food was excellent, the roasted pork was succulent, the crackling perfect and accompanying vegetables and mash potato a great match.
en-unannotated-04308	We were also glad they don't allow smoking at all in the raunt.
en-unannotated-04309	Good wifi and atmosphere.
en-unannotated-04310	The bed a bit on the hard side.
en-unannotated-04311	It was fantastic.
en-unannotated-04312	Room size was too small, not clean floors, dirty closet, smelly elevator car, window view was against a wall, bad quality finishes, very uncomfortable bed and good luck with street noise if you try to sleep early.
en-unannotated-04313	I hope it improves the name thou so boring
en-unannotated-04314	Wish to be possible to give 0 stars
en-unannotated-04315	If you happen to want to order anything you'll be made to feel that you are a total inconvenience...
en-unannotated-04316	Washing the whole thing down with a Beamish (no Guinness here surprisingly) made for a stereotypically Irish meal.
en-unannotated-04317	As always, this hotel is "unico" From the moment you step in until you check-out.
en-unannotated-04318	Old hotel restructured and you have suggestions of old times lived in this hotel
en-unannotated-04319	Had trouble ironing my clothes because the ironing board was the kind you use on a table.
en-unannotated-04320	Like some other traditional pintxo bar, there is no seats, I do think the best way to enjoy pintxos is standing and having some local wine:) Highly recommended!
en-unannotated-04321	Great value and excellent service.
en-unannotated-04322	N40°25.047' W3°42.631' Like to eat among TripAdvisor members without local people?
en-unannotated-04323	Great for coffee, pastries/sweets, pasta, cold cuts!
en-unannotated-04324	Brand new hotel, great location, nice clean rooms in an authentic old building.
en-unannotated-04325	This was probably one of the best hotels we've stayed at while traveling.
en-unannotated-04326	We walked to the collosseum in 30/40 mins and roughly the same for the Vatican.
en-unannotated-04327	The first night was amazing and the gnocchi gorgonzola was delicious.
en-unannotated-04328	Attention was a little slow, but Food was ok.
en-unannotated-04329	we were a little bit late as we got lost on the way
en-unannotated-04330	Recommend.
en-unannotated-04331	It is for sure one of the best chocolate you'll ever drink.
en-unannotated-04332	very old bed, quite uncomfortable, good size room.
en-unannotated-04333	Arrived early enough for dinner to partake in the early bird deal.
en-unannotated-04334	The Pho test really nice and taste similar to what I have in Danang and Hanoi.
en-unannotated-04335	App works for me on a samsung j3 but i cannot watch videos offline, if i try to watch something offline it doesnt even let me into the app.
en-unannotated-04336	My girlfriend and I went here on our first night in Barcelona!
en-unannotated-04337	Have stayed here a couple of times and each time it's been perfect!
en-unannotated-04338	Okay, to be fair, on the occasions I have eaten here - both times for breakfast - I have been accompanied by a lovely, warm and charming young lady.
en-unannotated-04339	Beef Cubes - with red wine, carrots etc over polenta.
en-unannotated-04340	A well thought out game!
en-unannotated-04341	Only down side no chef in the morning for fresh omelette's etc.
en-unannotated-04342	You not only will have an extraordinar foodexperice you will also experience a fun, creativity and passioned presentation of the courses.
en-unannotated-04343	We reserved a "superior" room for 4 days with a view of the zocalo (plaza). The room was huge, with a 2-sink bathroom and giant, attractive shower.
en-unannotated-04344	com has way oversold this property
en-unannotated-04345	I'm sure those weirdos don't get out much, but I do wish the staff would have maybe nudged them into being less obnoxious.
en-unannotated-04346	There is a lot of ads during the programmes which is annoying.
en-unannotated-04347	We ordered the burrata with heirloom tomatoes, shrimp and avocado, lamb two ways and squid with almost a red rice / jambalaya.
en-unannotated-04348	Why do you call yourself an italian restaurant if you serve american tastless & poor quality food?!
en-unannotated-04349	Also it was smaller than the photo attached to the booking confirmation.
en-unannotated-04350	So even though I bought the game I can advise others that it is not worth it to buy it.
en-unannotated-04351	They done an amazing job in combining tradition and contemporary luxury with service.
en-unannotated-04352	You need to...
en-unannotated-04353	Did I already mention my burger was absolutely fabulous??
en-unannotated-04354	They even sent some Iberico ham up to the room and a bottle of Cava was brought into the room when we arrived.
en-unannotated-04355	On this visit I ordered the pork belly linguini with a herb bread to start.
en-unannotated-04356	It has so much potential and charm.
en-unannotated-04357	The simplicity of this place is endearing.
en-unannotated-04358	There is always tea and/or coffee available in the hallway to the rooms.
en-unannotated-04359	This place is awesome!
en-unannotated-04360	Put 18 strangers together with fantastic gastronomic flavors and what do you get...
en-unannotated-04361	Service and atmosphere were also good, and the restaurant was quite full considering this...
en-unannotated-04362	What a lovely Hotel!
en-unannotated-04363	Great selection of pastries in the old town.
en-unannotated-04364	The food was fabolous, the wines suited the food well and the atmosphere was relaxed and pleasant.
en-unannotated-04365	The confit of duck leg was served piping hot and it went well with the shredded red cabbage.
en-unannotated-04366	Bed AND PIllows is like you sleeping on a ROCK
en-unannotated-04367	I put, "Omg omg" as a review draft so I could remember how this experience was PHENOMENAL.
en-unannotated-04368	Taxi always available at front door.
en-unannotated-04369	The hotel is brand new with a lovely scent that greets you as soon as you step into the entry area.
en-unannotated-04370	I highly recommend this place, particularly if you have someone to occupy the seat across from you to deter old weirdos.
en-unannotated-04371	For a dessert, we shared a creme brûlée and a chocolate cake.
en-unannotated-04372	The barramundi sashimi they had was nice.
en-unannotated-04373	We stopped in for dinner and we stuffed ourselves with their unique selection of Czech inspired small plates and their own house made beers.
en-unannotated-04374	This was a cute, non-touristy restaurant.
en-unannotated-04375	Although it was busy, my friend and I scored a free table - a rarity given the small space but there are a few.
en-unannotated-04376	Simply delicious experience in the 10th.
en-unannotated-04377	The burrata was stunning, so soft and incredibly well seasoned with a sweet basil vinaigrette and tomato compote; the lamb was the softest and really decadent dish.
en-unannotated-04378	This is one of that restaurants that make you feel comfortable and still have awesome food.
en-unannotated-04379	At first glance when I at here seemed a bit of a dive, but as you progress further inside there is a quite cute and unexpected interior awaiting you.
en-unannotated-04380	Sadly, the service was also surly and the music playing in the background sounded like classic 80s FM radio.
en-unannotated-04381	It's okay.
en-unannotated-04382	Service and food is excellent.
en-unannotated-04383	Quite a walk to the center but its along the concha.
en-unannotated-04384	everything should be renovated as a five star hotel
en-unannotated-04385	The cheese is so tasty and creamy, and the insides bacon and potatoes as well as mixed herbs fit perfectly.
en-unannotated-04386	And after our diner the offered us some sweets - for free.
en-unannotated-04387	To recommend
en-unannotated-04388	My boyfriend had the veal with cream sauce and mushrooms, which was amazing.
en-unannotated-04389	No waiting or eagerness between the dishes.
en-unannotated-04390	Damn!
en-unannotated-04391	We came across this hidden little gem thanks to Yelp.
en-unannotated-04392	Great find using Yelp app.
en-unannotated-04393	Everything you could wish for.
en-unannotated-04394	Situated by the river and only 15 min walk into the town.
en-unannotated-04395	Really perfect ...
en-unannotated-04396	Portion sizes were small and I dare say there were a few members of the group who left still hungry.
en-unannotated-04397	Every course was lovely and generous as were the pairings and pours.
en-unannotated-04398	The service: 5/5. The place is run by a nice gentleman with a good command of English.
en-unannotated-04399	Fantastic - everything was perfect- the food, the staff and the place.
en-unannotated-04400	The carbonara is heaven!!!
en-unannotated-04401	Again, make reservations online through their website.
en-unannotated-04402	I understand they were busy but there needs to be better management in the kitchen.
en-unannotated-04403	This hotel meets everything I expect.
en-unannotated-04404	Very nice and cozy atmosphere.
en-unannotated-04405	An hotel full of antiques with marvellously comfortable beds takes some beating.
en-unannotated-04406	The stew warmed me up on a windy, rainy day, and helped me understand why the Irish eat so many stews!
en-unannotated-04407	He has been the best.
en-unannotated-04408	The meal comes with rice and a soft drink, and my girlfriend also ordered the mango coconut sticky rice dessert which she was obsessed with as well.
en-unannotated-04409	The owner, [NAME], was a joy to meet!
en-unannotated-04410	It is the second time I stayed in the hotel in the last 4 weeks.
en-unannotated-04411	The S express and dynamite rolls were amazing.
en-unannotated-04412	Once I was able to get a seat, I browsed through the menu - bam, it's extensive so that's already a good sign!
en-unannotated-04413	It's a very stylish place, very far from all kinds of Sturbucks.
en-unannotated-04414	Though the atmosphere is a little loud, it's only because Blackbird makes everyone so happy & excited.
en-unannotated-04415	Ovepriced, outdated, lack of character, 3 stars max, probably the worst SLH member.
en-unannotated-04416	I would highly recommend this place.
en-unannotated-04417	The soup was warm and comforting, exactly what I was craving after walking around outside on a chilly/overcast day.
en-unannotated-04418	The interior and ambiance here is beautiful.
en-unannotated-04419	There is always a...
en-unannotated-04420	Very little street noise.
en-unannotated-04421	Every single recommendation they have for you is a good option.
en-unannotated-04422	Food was amazing, and they had the best risotto in the world!
en-unannotated-04423	Some great hops out there, including the thick stout.
en-unannotated-04424	Very healpfull
en-unannotated-04425	The Swiss man that sat next to us said it's one of his favorite restaurants and what he thinks is true French cuisine and he always brings his friends there.
en-unannotated-04426	Me and a friend ordered two gratins, and wine.
en-unannotated-04427	The egg cocotte with duck foie gras and crème brûlée were both outstanding and a must try when you dine here.
en-unannotated-04428	Eat it as a good piece of fresh meat.
en-unannotated-04429	This little bistro was easy to find, we visited on a Friday night at 7.30pm and waited about ten minutes for a table, the French onion soup was a meal in itself and I also tried a salad and Creme Brûlée, all were delicious and I'll definitely return again.
en-unannotated-04430	Our server was great, discrete with birthday related questions, very prompt drink service.
en-unannotated-04431	Our waitress came by and shared the specials and took our order promptly.
en-unannotated-04432	This was probably the best service I experienced during my entire Paris trip and a nice change from the not necessarily rude, but rather curt service staff from other cafes.
en-unannotated-04433	This was a recommendation by my Airbnb host, so I had to give it a try!
en-unannotated-04434	It is definitely a must come too when in Ireland.
en-unannotated-04435	Enjoyable stay at The Hyatt Mexico City.
en-unannotated-04436	Comfortable room and lovely bathroom.
en-unannotated-04437	They had so many different options- it was difficult to choose.
en-unannotated-04438	We loved Astoria 7! On arrival we received a complimentary glass of wine.
en-unannotated-04439	Nintendo, you convinced me to buy this game in full.
en-unannotated-04440	I ordered the goulash with the bread dumplings and it was SO GOOD!
en-unannotated-04441	You get water, radishes and salt to dip them in and bread that is complementary.
en-unannotated-04442	Town centre is a little expensive so we went a bit out of town and we're happy with our choice.
en-unannotated-04443	Cute, cute, cute decor.
en-unannotated-04444	Stayed for 3 nights in 2 rooms with our grown daughters.
en-unannotated-04445	Some years ago it became part of the Four Seasons hotel group.
en-unannotated-04446	The location is small so I definitely recommend a reservation.
en-unannotated-04447	I can't speak for the smaller original one as it was full when we found it (it...
en-unannotated-04448	The entrees seem so simple, but yet they were so delicious; this just goes to show that sometimes less is more.
en-unannotated-04449	The enchiladas with red or green sauce are highly recommended!
en-unannotated-04450	Mattress overused and soft furnishings stained with red wine.
en-unannotated-04451	This game is the most funnest game EVA!!
en-unannotated-04452	Your ratings are going down because of this, many people are frustrated and can't use your app.
en-unannotated-04453	I had goulash in a bread bowl and it was delicious.
en-unannotated-04454	All natural...
en-unannotated-04455	Hotel was clean and food was awesome...
en-unannotated-04456	The food was outstanding and carefully prepared – all 7 courses (2 appetizers, soup, fish, meat, 2 desserts) were delicious, inventive and high quality.
en-unannotated-04457	This place is a local gem with good quality food at a great price.
en-unannotated-04458	The equation...
en-unannotated-04459	Unfortunately no restaurant at the hotel.
en-unannotated-04460	Kind of dumpy but in a fun sort of way.
en-unannotated-04461	And so you're full and thrilled amd giddy and pinch yourself-- and think : what good karma did I plant when?
en-unannotated-04462	Convenience.
en-unannotated-04463	The staff were amazing.
en-unannotated-04464	It was also much quieter.
en-unannotated-04465	Mac's was just A-OK for me.
en-unannotated-04466	Situation didn't improve when it came to the mains.
en-unannotated-04467	In fact, these dumplings set us off dumplings entirely until we sampled some outside the city and realized that dumplings could actually become the star of the show....
en-unannotated-04468	Bed was too small for my six foot 1 husband, his feet dangled out.
en-unannotated-04469	There are lots of bars and clubs on the street with very loud music.
en-unannotated-04470	Oh, just a delicious potato pancake stuffed with meat, veggies and other deliciousness.
en-unannotated-04471	Sausages were also delicious.
en-unannotated-04472	It's fantastic value, lovely atmosphere, lovely host and it's a small place so it's not too crowded or loud.
en-unannotated-04473	You have to really KNOW about it to be able to find it.
en-unannotated-04474	Great service.
en-unannotated-04475	:)
en-unannotated-04476	Came to Lokal looking for an authentic Czech meal.
en-unannotated-04477	Mini bar restocked daily with water and soft drinks.
en-unannotated-04478	This place is one of the best places I've dined at not just in France but in the world.
en-unannotated-04479	Food , music, drinks and ambience were superb.
en-unannotated-04480	Excellent choice.
en-unannotated-04481	No reservation no table , that l understand but he said l cant wait here for table!
en-unannotated-04482	There wasn't, so she said to come back in 15 minutes.
en-unannotated-04483	It was like eating in my grandmas house, and the food was incredible.
en-unannotated-04484	This Hyatt Place is a nice business hotel.
en-unannotated-04485	We each selected from the daily menu, which includes a starter, main course, dessert, and half bottle of wine each, and we even substituted a bottle of...
en-unannotated-04486	I will definitely try it again.
en-unannotated-04487	When in Rome, er...
en-unannotated-04488	Everyone that ate here was a foreigner and it wasn't even a full house on a Friday night!
en-unannotated-04489	In Paris, everyone has been serving my steak super pink even when I ask for well done so my hopes were low.
en-unannotated-04490	It is addictive and time consuming.
en-unannotated-04491	Great location, safe, clean, very centric.
en-unannotated-04492	Escargot: Eh, these were okay.
en-unannotated-04493	We were at the front on 3rd floor (315). The room was compact but comfortable.
en-unannotated-04494	Lets all do ourselves a favour here and get the blue cheese sauce next time we go.
en-unannotated-04495	The food there is just fine nothing wow!
en-unannotated-04496	If you are anywhere near Mexico City, there are...
en-unannotated-04497	Not having a Facebook, I can't really do that.
en-unannotated-04498	I am living in Barcellona for a while and this place is one of the best where to try proper pizza.
en-unannotated-04499	For dessert, my table ordered the lavender créme brûlée and the cappuccino mousse.
en-unannotated-04500	If you're traveling in Milan and looking for a local place, this is it.
en-unannotated-04501	The chicken had a rotten taste, dark in colour, and there were large pieces of skin too.
en-unannotated-04502	It's a tiny little restaurant but they have seating areas outside of the register so you can grab your seat first and then go up to the counter to order or order first and then find a seat.
en-unannotated-04503	This game might be on the market someday..
en-unannotated-04504	The food and the conversation were great.
en-unannotated-04505	Too expensive.
en-unannotated-04506	The Game itself is good but a statement everyone should agree with is there's TO MANY ADS!!!
en-unannotated-04507	very luxurious and elite place in Moscow, perfect service and interesting interier, good place for VIP business meetings and dating with classy model girls ;)
en-unannotated-04508	I snuck a bite and thought it was more of a chiffon than standard NY cheesecake, but therefore light-good after a large meal.
en-unannotated-04509	All the food we tried was really good.
en-unannotated-04510	Four prague, it is pricey.
en-unannotated-04511	I'd stack up The Survey Co to anything Las Vegas has to offer.
en-unannotated-04512	The decoration is genuine Italian, not overdone.
en-unannotated-04513	Perhaps we ordered the wrong items.
en-unannotated-04514	Enjoyed our stay, room was very spacious & comfortable bed(always important) had a meal in sports bar-food & service very good.
en-unannotated-04515	There is also no English menus available inside.
en-unannotated-04516	While on holiday in Paris my boyfriend and I decided to stay in Shangri-La Hotel.
en-unannotated-04517	I had the swordfish and the fish was good but most everything else on the plate was too salty and unappealing.
en-unannotated-04518	Make reservations.
en-unannotated-04519	Entree was a Dalmatian salt cod, and dessert was an almond and cherry cake.
en-unannotated-04520	It was just a bit too funky for me.
en-unannotated-04521	The bar staff were friendly and the mood was delightful and relaxed on a quiet Wednesday evening.
en-unannotated-04522	It is a shame to eat them.
en-unannotated-04523	Highly recommend!
en-unannotated-04524	My foodie in arms had their duck confit, which was good but a little over cooked for my taste.
en-unannotated-04525	There are some fantastic smells wafting through the room especially when a freshly cooked meal gets placed at a nearby table.
en-unannotated-04526	It was my last night in Paris and I splurged.
en-unannotated-04527	This time around my family ordered everything from the fish and chips to the spaghetti squash linguine.
en-unannotated-04528	It was like they had put essence or sweetener in it.
en-unannotated-04529	everyone spoke English, very helpful!!!
en-unannotated-04530	We brought a bottle over from the house (no cork fee) and had a two course menu.
en-unannotated-04531	Highly recommend!
en-unannotated-04532	The wine and the place are also very good.
en-unannotated-04533	The flavours are great, the consistency is what you'd want from a burger - not sloppy or dry - and the fact that all burgers come with a small side of chips is awesome.
en-unannotated-04534	With exception to the popcorn shrimp, the remaining dishes all arrived together which was a little surprising at the time, but due to the portion sizes and styles of dishes this wasn't a problem.
en-unannotated-04535	The Survey Co immediately makes an impression in the aesthetics department.
en-unannotated-04536	And who doesn't love a place that has a wide beer & cider selection and also serves a decent cocktail?!
en-unannotated-04537	Had a great time and it was definitely the highlight of the trip.
en-unannotated-04538	it is better.
en-unannotated-04539	A comfortable, well designed restaurant with spacious seating for a limited number of diners, La Candelo Resto serves an eclectic menu of dishes which I felt took many of their influences from the Middle East and Asia.
en-unannotated-04540	The absolute best tiramisu we've ever had in our lives.
en-unannotated-04541	It is best to make reservations because this place is really small.
en-unannotated-04542	The place is quite dark but lit up with candles at each table.
en-unannotated-04543	Great job to sell your unwanted stuff
en-unannotated-04544	Well worth a visit if you are nearby and would definitely come back!
en-unannotated-04545	We would never have found it without her suggestion.
en-unannotated-04546	For dinner, he ordered the harrissa lamb ribs, I got the peppered brisket buns with sriacha coleslaw (best thing ever). And we shared roasted pumpkin and broccolini.
en-unannotated-04547	But we made a reservation for the following night!
en-unannotated-04548	Usually when I get dragged off to one of these vegetarian places I leave with a huge hole in my stomach.
en-unannotated-04549	This restaurant is by far one of my favorite restaurants in the world!
en-unannotated-04550	Bene
en-unannotated-04551	The veal was tender and the wine just right.
en-unannotated-04552	First the staff is super friendly at this hotel, and the rooms are updated an above average.
en-unannotated-04553	Our neighbor had pizza and omelette and that tastier.
en-unannotated-04554	It was so good, that one of my friends had to go back and have two more of that same dish the day after.
en-unannotated-04555	sprite!
en-unannotated-04556	Its to old
en-unannotated-04557	And play lots of fun games!
en-unannotated-04558	Nice and friendly hosts.
en-unannotated-04559	The Oscar sauce is this spicy tomato cream sauce that is absolutely amazing.
en-unannotated-04560	Great breakfast and excellent coffee.
en-unannotated-04561	Not much else to say really.
en-unannotated-04562	A number of tourist spots were highly accessible from the hotel.
en-unannotated-04563	The good and wine were amazing.
en-unannotated-04564	We had the Irish breakfast and french toast.
en-unannotated-04565	This spot is not to be missed.
en-unannotated-04566	Food was superb - husband enjoyed the egg en cocotte + duck foie gras for an appetizer while I had a strawberry gazpacho, which was subtly tasteful.
en-unannotated-04567	For the final dish, I had the Farm Surprise (Organic strawberry/chocolate/vanilla Ice-cream in layers, fresh fruit, homemade meringue, Chantilly cream, nuts and blueberry coulis) which was the BEST part of the meal.
en-unannotated-04568	Yoghurt for desert very very nice.
en-unannotated-04569	Great location next to St.
en-unannotated-04570	Comfortable beds.
en-unannotated-04571	We ate a late dinner here tonight, on the recommendation of our Airbnb host and the reviews.
en-unannotated-04572	My advice:
en-unannotated-04573	It could be assumed that a restaurant of this look and feel would be expensive fine dining, but the prices are in fact quite reasonable for what is served - mains are in the $30 to $40 range.
en-unannotated-04574	Maybe an update without compromising the beauty
en-unannotated-04575	I think I found my new fave in the 10th!!
en-unannotated-04576	It is split into two halves, the restaurant dining area and the bar, and both have uninterrupted views of the Brisbane River and Story Bridge.
en-unannotated-04577	Between a friend and I we had ravioli, pasta with tomato sauce, cacio e pepe, and a Gorgonzola and walnut sauce.
en-unannotated-04578	Quatre Fromages aka Four cheese platter (€15.00)
en-unannotated-04579	Not too sweet...
en-unannotated-04580	After potting last ball timer will continue instead of returning to start resulting in you running out of time on the black.
en-unannotated-04581	Sleeping under a 400 year old fresco in an immaculately appointed, modern room created a wonderfully juxtaposed experience.
en-unannotated-04582	This was a GREAT hotel!
en-unannotated-04583	The location of this hotel was excellent for visiting both the historic centre (only a few kms by car), the large park with lots of museums, Condesa and Polanco.
en-unannotated-04584	Tea was good..
en-unannotated-04585	perfect!
en-unannotated-04586	We chose the Library Room, all the books and the beautiful color add a nostalgic feeling to it.
en-unannotated-04587	I ordered the Fermier; chicken gratin with vegetables.
en-unannotated-04588	Friendly and efficient service, relaxing and romantic atmosphere and excellent food.
en-unannotated-04589	It is a must do when in Paris and we will see you next time we are there!
en-unannotated-04590	It is really easy to control.
en-unannotated-04591	The waitstaff are able to list suggested sides and wines to go with the dish.
en-unannotated-04592	Special thanks to [name], [name], [name] who made my stay exeptional.
en-unannotated-04593	You will come back every day.
en-unannotated-04594	Good czech food and friendly staff made us enjoy our visit.
en-unannotated-04595	The food really was great and authentic and the prices were affordable.
en-unannotated-04596	This place is amazing!
en-unannotated-04597	Do you love hearing from your users as you continue to improve your games?
en-unannotated-04598	Tiny place on the Calle 31 de Agosto but worth the wait to get in.
en-unannotated-04599	Although our table wasn't set when we arrived the manager came directly to us to apologise for the 5 minute wait.
en-unannotated-04600	Very modern design.
en-unannotated-04601	The only gap is there is just one key person with English—the sommelier who speaks good English.
en-unannotated-04602	One of the dishes that we tried was the baked beef with sauce and eggs and bread dumplings.
en-unannotated-04603	Staff is professional and friendly.
en-unannotated-04604	The meat medium rare is really medium rare un régal.
en-unannotated-04605	seriously!
en-unannotated-04606	This is MY opinion.
en-unannotated-04607	1. Great location in centre of town.
en-unannotated-04608	I've changed my score from a 5 to a 4, and here's why: there's just simply not enough content.
en-unannotated-04609	Me and my wife celebrated two years of marriage at this lovely place.
en-unannotated-04610	Whether it was the special restaurant orders, fitness/spa facilities, concierge, or front desk, this hotel is the example of service.
en-unannotated-04611	Arrived, party of one, no reservation, on a Friday night.
en-unannotated-04612	The food...
en-unannotated-04613	Stop in here for a view of the building but stay here for the great food and service!
en-unannotated-04614	The fast and friendly service did wonders (doesn't it always?) and the meals were super classy.
en-unannotated-04615	Definetly a great hidden restaurant.
en-unannotated-04616	Though can I call this an hotel or just heaven!!!
en-unannotated-04617	I was in Madrid for a few days on a multi-city trip through Spain and Portugal, and I picked this Marriott property both to get the most out of my Platinum status and because of the positive reviews.
en-unannotated-04618	We would stay at this hotel again.
en-unannotated-04619	I had no clue what flavour to pick but was recommended the caramelised banana which was gorgeous!
en-unannotated-04620	They put in a new battery so i thought the problem is solved as it was partly to with the battery but now its happening again.
en-unannotated-04621	The amount of burger you get for your money is amazing, These burgers are huge.
en-unannotated-04622	there were no slippers in the room, no toothbrushes, no shower gel (we used to wash with bath foam).
en-unannotated-04623	Oh, also, the toilet was clean.
en-unannotated-04624	Guests will need 20min without traffic to reach main programs and at rush hours it could take way longer.
en-unannotated-04625	Also not sure I trust the scanner completely..
en-unannotated-04626	I had the duck with bananas Duck was tasty, bananas were very good - duck may be a little tough but I believe that is how it is usually.
en-unannotated-04627	Totally worth if you stayed at Room Mate hotel...
en-unannotated-04628	It's only the Asians who get hangry at this time and must stop for food apparently.
en-unannotated-04629	They insisted on an early arrival but didnt show up themself to give the keys until we called.
en-unannotated-04630	Firstly, we saw the high reviews for La Cordonnerie on Yelp and asked our concierge about making a reservation.
en-unannotated-04631	These problems aren't apparent on the browser version of soundcloud, so i would expect them to be absent from the app
en-unannotated-04632	io is an awesome game.
en-unannotated-04633	Very solid, nice atmosphere, lovely beer selection and I even found a cider that I liked.
en-unannotated-04634	Great place to go for breakfast
en-unannotated-04635	After recent update, opened app & was greeted with the login with Facebook page, but when I click the login button, it pops up with 'already logged in as xxx' message.
en-unannotated-04636	Today I saw the newly placed an english board.
en-unannotated-04637	Had a great waiter called [NAME], Who bought special dishes out to give us a taste of all the cuisines of Japanese food.
en-unannotated-04638	rooms good...
en-unannotated-04639	We sat at the bar, and found the bartenders to be attentive, cheerful, and just generally great.
en-unannotated-04640	We stopped in because of recommendations from our tour guide and good Yelp reviews, and we were not disappointed.
en-unannotated-04641	Helpful, courteous staff was very responsive.
en-unannotated-04642	The hotel is old and the rate is expensive.
en-unannotated-04643	The only reason I would not give them a higher review is the service.
en-unannotated-04644	The pastries look nice but are over priced for the quality.
en-unannotated-04645	It is ALWAYS busy.
en-unannotated-04646	We decided to share the pork knee and we were glad we did since the dish is really rich but every bite was delicious.
en-unannotated-04647	When I saw this restaurant, I wasn't exactly sure how much it would cost and how good the food is.
en-unannotated-04648	Why?
en-unannotated-04649	Inside is gorgeous, comfortable and relaxed setting.
en-unannotated-04650	Blown away by how delicious this all was.
en-unannotated-04651	Location of the hotel is awesome - walking distance from almost all the major locations
en-unannotated-04652	A couple minutes walk from tons of shopping and the castle.
en-unannotated-04653	We called reception to open the TV .
en-unannotated-04654	The service was equal to the food.
en-unannotated-04655	They were all amazing, but the cacio e pepe and Gorgonzola pastas were even better than amazing.
en-unannotated-04656	I was impressed.
en-unannotated-04657	The rissoto was very good but the pasta was the star of the meal.
en-unannotated-04658	I also do not know why the ratings are so high for this place.
en-unannotated-04659	Good service, atmosphere and drinks...
en-unannotated-04660	The restaurant was packed like sardines.
en-unannotated-04661	Also, my friend wanted to buy a bottle of wine for her family and the manager spent quite some time going over all the wines they had available and helped her choose the best wine to take back.
en-unannotated-04662	Both were delicious!
en-unannotated-04663	My boyfriend also enjoyed his starter with ham and mozzarella.
en-unannotated-04664	We had an excellent lunch here!
en-unannotated-04665	On arrival we were seated at an excellent table with the...
en-unannotated-04666	It tasted fantastic too - the duck breast was perfectly cooked and still slightly pink and the confit leg stuffed cabbage was soft and incredibly flavourful.
en-unannotated-04667	Service couldn't be faulted.
en-unannotated-04668	It's the only thing that let the experience down.
en-unannotated-04669	That's alot for any mobile game good or great.
en-unannotated-04670	We enjoyed it very much
en-unannotated-04671	Despite many efforts over the past couple of years I have never managed to secure a table in the Vintage Kitchen, so when I heard it had a little sibling I set my sights here instead for a date night and was so so glad I did.
en-unannotated-04672	The space is well used and outfitted, and the decor actually hides how small the locale is quite well.
en-unannotated-04673	Walking distance from the Alameda Central, Bellas Artes, and the Torre Latino.
en-unannotated-04674	I don't understand what just happened tonight.
en-unannotated-04675	There is virtually no parking, and once inside - it is SRO on weekend nights.
en-unannotated-04676	Luckily this was served on a seashell not as a part of the main dish, the rest of which was lovely.
en-unannotated-04677	Having heard and read so much about this place, I knew I had to take time out and go to The False Door when in Bogota.
en-unannotated-04678	I told this to hotel and they said maybe it confused with laundry they called there but couldnt find and it was inside of my luggage ı am sure that ı put there ...
en-unannotated-04679	The other dishes we ordered were also delicious but that ceviche was the highlight!
en-unannotated-04680	Excellent location.
en-unannotated-04681	The service was good, we didn't really ask for much other than beer.
en-unannotated-04682	Was expecting much more.
en-unannotated-04683	This was the BEST restaurant I visited during my stay in Paris.
en-unannotated-04684	If you don't want a meal, they have a cheese platter or a meat platter for sharing with your beer.
en-unannotated-04685	As a Courtyard, I was surprised by the full, high quality restaurant on site (complete with room service).
en-unannotated-04686	You must visit here and try some of the goodies....
en-unannotated-04687	Rooms were large and clean.
en-unannotated-04688	And at the conclusion , they bring a basket full , a mound of clementines, plus a carafe of limoncello -- no they don't deliver and wait for you to pour a tassito-- you look around the tables and each has its own carafe.
en-unannotated-04689	The conceirge was extremely rude and abrupt and told me that was the room that I booked and she couldn't move us.
en-unannotated-04690	Cataluinian regional drinks, then a choice in new world wines starts with cloudy bay a souvignon blanc from New Zeeland worth to mention, also a Saké. The...
en-unannotated-04691	Joe burger has literally the best burgers you can get in Paris for that price!!!
en-unannotated-04692	It's stunning place, unique look, good location next door to the famous Pushkin cafe but food was really average.
en-unannotated-04693	Great service , good food and a fantastic ambiance.
en-unannotated-04694	Oh really, so we can stay, pay full price but get the eff out quickly or else.
en-unannotated-04695	The ambiance was cozy without being claustrophobic.
en-unannotated-04696	It was so clean and recently completed, plus we had a balcony!
en-unannotated-04697	We were doing business in Bogotá and we stayed in a hotel close to this jewel of French cuisine.
en-unannotated-04698	Nothing to fault, except that there are only 2-3 vegan options.
en-unannotated-04699	Excellent italian food.
en-unannotated-04700	A staple for any trips to Paris!
en-unannotated-04701	Great hotel!
en-unannotated-04702	Good guide assistant service.
en-unannotated-04703	Huge portions of delicious food.
en-unannotated-04704	Most of the staff were nice.
en-unannotated-04705	We went to Nase Maso as our first meal.
en-unannotated-04706	Stopped in for lunch without reservations on a Friday and got seated right away.
en-unannotated-04707	This is simply a deceiving costumer app.
en-unannotated-04708	Burger was definitely up to the juiciness you expect from a fresh made burger, and along with the brioche bun, it was a perfect match.
en-unannotated-04709	Omg its really cool but there is something thad sucks its thad we need to buy the robux because those players thad are pretty much kids and the kids will ask the parents if they can buy robux but the parents dont allow them.
en-unannotated-04710	Great seafood in a dive-y atmosphere, bright lights and no chairs, crowded because it's obviously great and popular.
en-unannotated-04711	Our table was "that table". We were loud and having fun, feeling a little bit silly in our attire but embracing it all the way.
en-unannotated-04712	Stop by!
en-unannotated-04713	The atmosphere is lovely, warm, and casually elegant.
en-unannotated-04714	I was not thrilled or satisfied after eating here.
en-unannotated-04715	best coffee in San Sebastian Donostia!!
en-unannotated-04716	What a delicious spot in Dublin!
en-unannotated-04717	No air conditioning in the living room but a/c in bedrooms.
en-unannotated-04718	Thank you!
en-unannotated-04719	Super inconsistent, but consistently frustrating.
en-unannotated-04720	I've used it once and now I can't get back in.
en-unannotated-04721	When I went up to pay, there was this big bowl of candy so I went to town with the candy but the server and his brother brought out even bigger candies and gifted them to me.
en-unannotated-04722	Highly recommend paying this restaurant a visit !
en-unannotated-04723	Came here to experience "traditional" Czech food.
en-unannotated-04724	Very good food: an excellent mix of Corse tradition and creativity.
en-unannotated-04725	My daughter got it on her iPod and I tried it thinking it was going to be dumb.
en-unannotated-04726	It was the best dish of snails I have had in my entire life!
en-unannotated-04727	I really like the P.Macs!
en-unannotated-04728	Great modern and confortable hotel!
en-unannotated-04729	I usually don't write reviews but this restaurant deserves it!
en-unannotated-04730	I used to love this but now I have a big blue line saying its been renamed wouldn't be bothered but on some apps n sites it's right across where im typing, so I can't see what I've typed,  I have to keep taking the keyboard off so I can check what I've typed.
en-unannotated-04731	While walking through Moscow in these cold days you will enjoy acceptable food, polite staff and nice position in Arbat.
en-unannotated-04732	Definitely a more upscale Courtyard than others.
en-unannotated-04733	They serve beer made at the monastery- the day we went they were serving a great blueberry beer.
en-unannotated-04734	It was soooo good!
en-unannotated-04735	The food was delicious, the service was excellent.
en-unannotated-04736	They start you off on the house with a copa of grappa or pinot Grigio , I think.
en-unannotated-04737	I followed the advice of fellow Yelpers and ordered the Pork Knee - it was amazing.
en-unannotated-04738	Professional staff.
en-unannotated-04739	Better macaroons can be found elsewhere in Paris but the other pastries are fantastic!
en-unannotated-04740	There were quite a few people enjoying all manner of cocktails (ranging from the classic to the exotic), and wine as well.
en-unannotated-04741	This is a lovely restaurant in La Candelaria, quite small and cozy, you can sit upstairs also.
en-unannotated-04742	Kinda felt like a secret entrance (even through you can see the place through the windows).
en-unannotated-04743	not polite.
en-unannotated-04744	It was simply wonderful.
en-unannotated-04745	No change log.
en-unannotated-04746	Good food and friendly staff.
en-unannotated-04747	Toad Rally is fun at first, but becomes a grind after a while, and I don't really care for all the fluffy animations and loading times that's keeping me from fighting my next opponent.
en-unannotated-04748	Pastas were well-constructed.
en-unannotated-04749	The staff are very friendly and helpful.
en-unannotated-04750	This restaurant is one of my favorite ones of French food!!
en-unannotated-04751	My husband and I were celebrating his birthday in Barcelona when he found this little gem of a restaurant hidden in the heart of the city.
en-unannotated-04752	The rooms on the 6th floor might be affected by the noise on the terrace when there is any company celebration or party.
en-unannotated-04753	We booked this restaurant for my birthday having read the reviews on Trip Advisor, and by god, am I glad that we did.
en-unannotated-04754	Cloistered away from the hustle of street level Verve is a great place for coffee catch-ups, dinner dates, after work drinks or general cider-swigging merriment.
en-unannotated-04755	Off the beaten path, but well worth the visit!
en-unannotated-04756	We were expecting more explanation from the...
en-unannotated-04757	Very good.
en-unannotated-04758	You can...
en-unannotated-04759	They treated us with kindness and with the grace of good friends.
en-unannotated-04760	They aren't making a lot of pastries, but they don't have to.
en-unannotated-04761	Staff so warm.
en-unannotated-04762	The seating area is small with 4 high tables so it may be tough if you're planning on dining in, but certainly have the option of getting it to-go instead.
en-unannotated-04763	absolutely below any standards
en-unannotated-04764	In reality, all the rooms are quite old and need a remake.
en-unannotated-04765	My favourites are the BBQ Bulgogi burger and the Smoked Miso Pork belly.
en-unannotated-04766	And I know it's not my wifi I tried playing different games and I never had this problem.
en-unannotated-04767	Each plate got better and better.
en-unannotated-04768	While visiting Paris, I really wanted to make a point to visit the cozy Parisian bistros I've only heard about.
en-unannotated-04769	I see no problem with them.
en-unannotated-04770	Highly recommend to all coffee lovers.
en-unannotated-04771	We ordered a classic burger with bacon and wanted them well done, however we got our meat pink and onions even though we explicitly told them not to put them onto our burger.
en-unannotated-04772	Yes, it's probably one of Brissie's more flashier restaurants, but it's wroth it for sure.
en-unannotated-04773	Moreover sometimes I just run out of time abruptly, even when the timer bar is 70% full.
en-unannotated-04774	Delicious dinner in hotel restaurant.
en-unannotated-04775	Very relaxing.
en-unannotated-04776	Incredible pasta in an extremely busy yet very friendly family-style restaurant in Milan.
en-unannotated-04777	We got 2 towels for 5 nights
en-unannotated-04778	There was one woman in the dining room upstairs serving, bussing, and hostessing.
en-unannotated-04779	This is the only gap.
en-unannotated-04780	Go to the Restaurant on the cliff top overlooking the entry to the port
en-unannotated-04781	Wonderful meal!
en-unannotated-04782	You are located just a couple of minutes away from the Tuttle Crossing Mall and lots of dining options.
en-unannotated-04783	Loved how there was plenty of seafood to go around.
en-unannotated-04784	We had a caprese salad to start, a Margherita pizza, both were outstanding and tasty.
en-unannotated-04785	The neighborhood is close to shopping, museums, restaurants, and attractions.
en-unannotated-04786	This is a great boutique hotel right in the heart of Madrid.
en-unannotated-04787	The rooms are lovely and very comfortable.
en-unannotated-04788	EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT.
en-unannotated-04789	Make reservations for dinner because it gets packed!
en-unannotated-04790	The room was to dark for ny liking.
en-unannotated-04791	U can race others to level up ur castle some are rigged some are fair.
en-unannotated-04792	All kinds of mussels served and we tasted many different kinds and they were all very good.
en-unannotated-04793	Throughout our stay in Paris, we visited several highly recommended restaurants (including a few recommended by name, as well) and I must say, this was definitely the BEST meal we...
en-unannotated-04794	and even have a bit for our toddler.
en-unannotated-04795	The competition is tough  though, with many variations.
en-unannotated-04796	The place is tiny and isn't that appealing, the tapas were decent, and at this cost I didn't have high expectations.
en-unannotated-04797	I had to visit the oldest pub in Dublin.
en-unannotated-04798	Each dish was under $10 (calculated based on current exchange rate), very reasonable and highly recommended for travelers with adventurous gourmet preferences.
en-unannotated-04799	As we had 5 people in our party, we ordered all the 4 starters on the menu and they were all absolutely fantastic.
en-unannotated-04800	Staffed by people with moustaches so large they have to drink their coffee with a straw (I'm not joking), you'd be forgiven for thinking you'd stepped onto the set of a Wes Anderson film.
en-unannotated-04801	Walked out with a smile on my face.
en-unannotated-04802	He make coffee mixes by himself and roast it.
en-unannotated-04803	It was totally worth the price and I definitely recommend getting it if you are looking to only order one thing off the menu.
en-unannotated-04804	90% of the people that come here are local.
en-unannotated-04805	When we went there was one woman who was the cook and server for the entire place.
en-unannotated-04806	Room  doors and corridors and walls needs major renovation .
en-unannotated-04807	My burberry scarve stolen from my room..
en-unannotated-04808	The employees are very friendly too, which was demonstrated after a small problem occured.
en-unannotated-04809	best goulash ever!
en-unannotated-04810	Every drink was carefully measured and mixed.
en-unannotated-04811	I ate there almost every night for a week.
en-unannotated-04812	Im a Vietnamese and i have to say that the food here is really delicious.
en-unannotated-04813	Feels very authentic and the food is amazing.
en-unannotated-04814	We also split two of the cheeses.
en-unannotated-04815	The prices are high as you would expect but you do get what you pay for.
en-unannotated-04816	Typical hipster bar/snacking ambience.
en-unannotated-04817	12/8/16
en-unannotated-04818	The other people were tremendous - it is important to socialise and get on together as it is part...
en-unannotated-04819	I ended up with eggs benedict boxty style (which ended up getting unknowingly upgraded to the salmon version and briefly panicked I'd get charged for it, but it seemed to be a mistake).
en-unannotated-04820	when i play with one of the legendary cue every time its aim, spin , power and time automatically reduce as same as beginner cue.
en-unannotated-04821	I found it hard to eat with most things coming in these bowls that were very full.
en-unannotated-04822	My friend had the lasagna and i had pear tortellini with walnuts and they were perfect!
en-unannotated-04823	I learned enough French to ask for a table for two.
en-unannotated-04824	Borsh is something that people from other countries should try.
en-unannotated-04825	If you weren't sure what to have just look around, everyone are having the same dish and they are right.
en-unannotated-04826	Breakfast buffet included, ok but nothing to rave about.
en-unannotated-04827	Only simple meals but delicious.
en-unannotated-04828	They changed the soup but the memory of an insect in my food is hard to forget.
en-unannotated-04829	The cocktail artist was also very attentive and always checked in on my friend and me.
en-unannotated-04830	For dessert, we couldnt make up our mind which one to order so we asked for suggestion.
en-unannotated-04831	Very attentive and it...
en-unannotated-04832	Fabulous food, friendly staff, clean and good prices.
en-unannotated-04833	The second dish is the sea bass.
en-unannotated-04834	Thank you for a great lunch welcome to Madrid!
en-unannotated-04835	The staff were negative when we said we needed help with menu translation to English and we are not unfamiliar or...
en-unannotated-04836	The presentations were unique and appropriate.
en-unannotated-04837	I am so happy we did, because not only was the service excellent, the price was good, and the churros plus the chocolate sauce were...
en-unannotated-04838	This was my first dinner experience via "Eat With" and I am more than satisfied.
en-unannotated-04839	They had a surprising amount of options for vegetarians, and some were adaptable to vegans.
en-unannotated-04840	It was an excellent experience.
en-unannotated-04841	The staff was very friendly.
en-unannotated-04842	I caught cold and request a heater from reception and they told me that they can not support.
en-unannotated-04843	I recommend going when it opens, 8 pm, but worry not, even if you don't get a seat, there's a restaurant on the same block just across the street that has the same menu!
en-unannotated-04844	I will definitely visit again
en-unannotated-04845	We had our first dinner at L'Estrapade on a Tuesday night; it was so remarkable that we immediately made a reservation to return on Friday night.
en-unannotated-04846	The wine list is limited, but a couple of good white/red selections.
en-unannotated-04847	The only one thing to...
en-unannotated-04848	The street musicians start playing in the afternoon right across the road.
en-unannotated-04849	They'll give you plates when you get in.
en-unannotated-04850	The ads aren't overly plentiful, and they don't interfere with gameplay.
en-unannotated-04851	This was his favorite version.
en-unannotated-04852	A wonderful sweet, fruity and creamy dish to finish the dining experience with.
en-unannotated-04853	A total bill of €78 was icing on the cake!
en-unannotated-04854	Or if you'd like to tackle a second pasta dish, the spaghetti carbonara seemed to be a crowd favorite as it was literally on everyone's table.
en-unannotated-04855	I'm going to jump right to it because the food here doesn't need any explanation; it speaks for itself.
en-unannotated-04856	Location is good, near restaurantes and comercial area.
en-unannotated-04857	Really loved the decor here, beautiful bistro feel to the place with wonderful tiles and glasswork.
en-unannotated-04858	It is regarded as a superior caviar restaurant, but I am not a caviar lover so I cannot comment on that aspect of the menu.
en-unannotated-04859	Great 3 fix price menu as well.
en-unannotated-04860	So the good - the veal, and the white wine and mushroom reduction sauce it had on it was absolutely fantastic.
en-unannotated-04861	We would definitely stay here again!
en-unannotated-04862	If you are...
en-unannotated-04863	Doesn't hurt that the waitstaff are charming and easy on the eyes.
en-unannotated-04864	Scheduled to be completed in April.
en-unannotated-04865	Jelly Fish makes a big splash!
en-unannotated-04866	Check in was relatively straightforward.
en-unannotated-04867	The furniture is a crazy mix of old stuff that they probably found at a yard sale and this choice of decor adds to the relaxed feel of the place.
en-unannotated-04868	You ring the bell, and tell them your name.
en-unannotated-04869	Service was excellent.
en-unannotated-04870	Family room a fantastic size but bathrooms are dated.
en-unannotated-04871	Good for a romantic diner.
en-unannotated-04872	It's a tiny little bistro where you watch the chef prepare your meal.
en-unannotated-04873	I've always wanted to try an egg white omelette and never knew it could taste so good!
en-unannotated-04874	Wat I don't like in this game is all your old scores and levels wat u had achieved and completed with your old hand set does not get transferred to your new phone and you have to start from the scratch all over.
en-unannotated-04875	We loved dining at Midi 12 over the week we spent in Paris!
en-unannotated-04876	It would be better if you could use it to buy a ticket.
en-unannotated-04877	It would be fine if it was cheap but the prices were a lot higher than...
en-unannotated-04878	But given the class and level of service the food is not what it should be.
en-unannotated-04879	Because after waiting for literally over 1 hour, our waiter decided to blatantly ignore us trying to wave him down.
en-unannotated-04880	They do one thing well!
en-unannotated-04881	Also had the Farm Mess to finish and I was not disappointed, meringue , ice cream and fruit; not to be missed.
en-unannotated-04882	The hotel is a former Tryp Ambassador which was fully refurbished and opened in the summer 2016 as a Gran Melia Hotel.
en-unannotated-04883	He was not responsive or even rude to our requests.
en-unannotated-04884	the front desk was nothing but helpful, friendly, and lovely; the service was great; the front desk was great with directions,recommendations and reservations
en-unannotated-04885	Spa was large and offered great services.
en-unannotated-04886	Last time, we went for a family lunch, on a Sunday afternoon in late March.
en-unannotated-04887	used to work but keeps crashing mid programme awful app, too many errors!!
en-unannotated-04888	The bottled beer selection is surprisingly good.
en-unannotated-04889	Out of the center in a nice residential area.
en-unannotated-04890	Would recommend for a quick meal, but may be hard finding a table during peak times.
en-unannotated-04891	They have a variety of toasts; we tried the strawberry and avocado.
en-unannotated-04892	Outstanding breakfast (fresh fruit, outstanding coffee, eggs to order, and meats).
en-unannotated-04893	After all said and done, the bill was pretty big after ordering to prix fixe meals and 2 drinks.
en-unannotated-04894	It's a great app without premium, but it's especially sweet with premium.
en-unannotated-04895	Booking: "mandatory"
en-unannotated-04896	charming old building with huge rooms, extremely spacious.
en-unannotated-04897	We got complementary prosecco and appetizers.
en-unannotated-04898	It was a quick walk to the hop on city bus for exploring Madrid.
en-unannotated-04899	Just be aware that if you have to get up to go to the bathroom you may have to actually move the table (and have someone else move their table) to get out of the booth.
en-unannotated-04900	, the location is superb, is situated on the main beachfront promenade at La Concha, and its considered one of the finest urban beach in the world .
en-unannotated-04901	The mint yogurt was a perfect combo for the fish; but it was basically good yogurt dip and I did not taste much mint in it all.
en-unannotated-04902	-Proscuitto e melone: I think this is a must wherever you go in Italy.
en-unannotated-04903	2). Great service.
en-unannotated-04904	Water Closet Lock not working properly.
en-unannotated-04905	A bit crowded.
en-unannotated-04906	Saké.
en-unannotated-04907	Just checked in to another great room at this hotel, I've stayed here multiple times and every time its been above expectation.
en-unannotated-04908	with a smile.
en-unannotated-04909	The sauce that goes with it is fantastic, but the fish itself have no taste to it.
en-unannotated-04910	Fabulous Hotel, excellent service, welcome champagne in the modern people watching bar.
en-unannotated-04911	Didn't get any food, went and asked where it was...
en-unannotated-04912	Location is perfect, close to all the sights, great restaurants and boutique shops.
en-unannotated-04913	We made that disappear quick and ordered a bottle of the house red and a bottle of sparkling water.
en-unannotated-04914	Heaven!
en-unannotated-04915	The Bank on College Green was fantastic.
en-unannotated-04916	The wait staff were very attentive, though it was a quiet night, and the restaurant has a mâitre d' to seat guests and check coats and bags.
en-unannotated-04917	But a party that had reserved never showed up (major loss) so we got their seats!
en-unannotated-04918	He even gave us a free pizza because he overheard us wanting a pizza.
en-unannotated-04919	A good terasse with view on the river.
en-unannotated-04920	Of note, the steak boxty is covered in cream sauce -if you have an aversion to dairy, don't get this!
en-unannotated-04921	Nice cosy rooms and a homely breakfast area and the very curt Mr Inaki made our stay very pleasant.
en-unannotated-04922	The location was perfect to explore the area with so man restaurants to choose from.
en-unannotated-04923	I would highly recommend this hotel due to the staff, the facility and the mall attached.
en-unannotated-04924	As everyone stated, it is centrally located, 5min walk N.
en-unannotated-04925	I loved the toys for my toddler.
en-unannotated-04926	Nothing bad about it, but special neither.
en-unannotated-04927	I recommend if you don't want to spend the big bucks next door at the Hilton.
en-unannotated-04928	The food was brilliant.
en-unannotated-04929	It is almost same price and very comfortable.
en-unannotated-04930	I only rate on a 1 a 3 or a 5 to make it easier.
en-unannotated-04931	Location
en-unannotated-04932	The location of the property is great it is in a central location for all the exclusive shopping and restaurants, and Spanish steps, Trevi fountain and other attractions all in walking distance, about 30 minutes from Vatican City if walking.
en-unannotated-04933	Very pleasant.
en-unannotated-04934	The whole...
en-unannotated-04935	Stayed at Soitel.
en-unannotated-04936	Overall amazing spectacular experience
en-unannotated-04937	We had a lovely evening chatting with Loly and the other...
en-unannotated-04938	The decor is beautiful, the rooms are lovely and the service fantastic.
en-unannotated-04939	What a truly amazing dining space.
en-unannotated-04940	so good.
en-unannotated-04941	The blue cheese risotto, gnocchi and lasagne are my go to meals here.
en-unannotated-04942	Would recommend!
en-unannotated-04943	All drawers are not practical.
en-unannotated-04944	The pork ribs came with just the right amount of bbq sauce.
en-unannotated-04945	You get a heaping plate of meat (steak, chicken, ham, and other choices) with several different sauces you select.
en-unannotated-04946	Really good restaurant for Dinner and Breakfast.
en-unannotated-04947	I would recommend anyone from Asia who may looking for tasty food that taste like original one.
en-unannotated-04948	Over priced.
en-unannotated-04949	Have to close app and re open to send pictures and text sometimes.
en-unannotated-04950	Clean,comfortable,cheap
en-unannotated-04951	Because it TOTALLY delivered for both of us!
en-unannotated-04952	Also had green spot whiskey for the first time and it's probably the smoothest ever.
en-unannotated-04953	I don't know if there's another way to get to BREW, but the way we went was a bit sketchy with a long walk down an ally.
en-unannotated-04954	But besides that there are many other delicious options.
en-unannotated-04955	However they were already out of their chocolate pancakes that early in the morning.
en-unannotated-04956	The atmosphere is very warm and welcoming, serving the best Gratins ever.
en-unannotated-04957	Wine prices are reasonable too.
en-unannotated-04958	No snootiness here.
en-unannotated-04959	I ordered a salmon and I expected at least a nice sauce.
en-unannotated-04960	Would definitely return.
en-unannotated-04961	I had chicharrónes in a delicious sauce to start and Veracruz style tongue.
en-unannotated-04962	4 members of my family have Coeliaces disease and this bakery provided an excellent range of food, the whole menu is gluten free and the food is amazing!
en-unannotated-04963	It is served with mashed potatoes on top.
en-unannotated-04964	The restaurant uses local and seasonal ingredients so the food is of high quality.
en-unannotated-04965	Went to this cafe as it was #1 on deserts in Madrid.
en-unannotated-04966	Loved this place and plan to go back.
en-unannotated-04967	If you agree rate this 4 or 5.
en-unannotated-04968	The coffee is quite strong and tasty, the place is nice.
en-unannotated-04969	My favorite bar of all time.
en-unannotated-04970	4 tiny wall-mounted tables.
en-unannotated-04971	We had the wagyu beef and the swordfish and they were both to die for - tender, juicy and full of flavor.
en-unannotated-04972	We, two couples, stayed at Monte Ulia for 2 nights.
en-unannotated-04973	The decor is vintage classy, we actually thought we might be under attired but we were fine.
en-unannotated-04974	He, of course, recommended the egg en cocotte with duck foie gras appetizer which truly was superb.
en-unannotated-04975	We ordered the duck leg (of course), the fried Romadur cheese, and the goose pate.
en-unannotated-04976	It was also nice how the place was open late.
en-unannotated-04977	I recommend a small bottle of wine if you're a couple otherwise you leave it there without finishing it.
en-unannotated-04978	Like did no one noticed the freakin Hitler & Mussolini pictures!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
en-unannotated-04979	I don't even have my work history Public on Facebook.
en-unannotated-04980	For mains, I heard good reviews of the raquefort ravioli so we went straight for the beef ragout ravioli (huge portion) and another main of roast chicken spatchcock.
en-unannotated-04981	We came at around noon on a Friday and there were plenty of seats.
en-unannotated-04982	When we realized it at midnight we asked for a car for the next morning to pick us up for the airport .
en-unannotated-04983	Jellyfish is the type of fancy restaurant that a struggling writer/student does not really get the chance to go to.
en-unannotated-04984	I came here for lunch with my boyfriend on a Thursday around 1:30. We made reservations in advance, which seem to be a must, as most if not all the tables were taken.
en-unannotated-04985	The other meal that came to the table was a steak, which was ok at best.
en-unannotated-04986	Prices very fair.
en-unannotated-04987	We tried the house beers, which were very good and went well with the food.
en-unannotated-04988	Restaurant Ok.
en-unannotated-04989	Now little did I know I would be stumbling into one of my favorite restaurants of all time!
en-unannotated-04990	The service is excellent, they try hard to please.
en-unannotated-04991	They do not split that bill.
en-unannotated-04992	I love, love, love butter so I had absolutely no problem with this, especially when France has some of the best butter in the world.
en-unannotated-04993	The gnocchi was soft and paired really well with the Oscar sauce, which was creamy.
en-unannotated-04994	The airport shuttle is very efficient and convenient.
en-unannotated-04995	Immerged in the green with a great terrace this typical Corsican restaurant offers great genuine quality local food.
en-unannotated-04996	The tasting menu did look great though.
en-unannotated-04997	The sausages were not distinctive however the horseradish was yummy.
en-unannotated-04998	You rock!!
en-unannotated-04999	I just love this game because it's so cool if you get your life to 10,000 that would be your record.
en-unannotated-05000	The hot chocolate is unlike anything you have had before.
en-unannotated-05001	The menu was completely in French but the young friendly owner was so warm and accommodating .
en-unannotated-05002	An excellent place to grab some quick food after a visit to The State Tretyakov Gallery.
en-unannotated-05003	Bring your own food if you want to eat here, you might have to wait for a while before they actually serve you anything...
en-unannotated-05004	WOW.
en-unannotated-05005	Staff was always there and helpful.
en-unannotated-05006	One bathroom toilet leaked.
en-unannotated-05007	Other people say they're worms but it spacifically says "move your SNAKE around to eat!!
en-unannotated-05008	I much prefer the Four Seasons and St. Regis but this area is so nice that it is not a bad option.
en-unannotated-05009	I hope this review will also help wandering tourists who don't want to be "touristy" and support some local run family bistros like this one!
en-unannotated-05010	Highly recommended.
en-unannotated-05011	My wife and I and our two grown kids were looking for an interesting and relaxing weekend away from L.
en-unannotated-05012	The marvelous focaccia to start and little glass of limoncello to end the meal continue as lovely touches.
en-unannotated-05013	Tap to jump and in true Mario fashion.
en-unannotated-05014	Make sure you book the skip the tours queues as they are great and worth paying for.
en-unannotated-05015	Cheers.
en-unannotated-05016	What it can do however, it does very well.
en-unannotated-05017	You know you're in for something special the moment you arrive.
en-unannotated-05018	I was here with my girlfriend and the food is really really awesome.
en-unannotated-05019	Refuses to launch unless installed on internal memory.
en-unannotated-05020	Being the only vegetarian at the table I ordered a delicate artichoke salad with the most glamorous trio of vegetables, potato and pumpkin puree .
en-unannotated-05021	The salad was lightly dressed greens with walnuts pine nuts and cherry tomato.
en-unannotated-05022	If I was downloading songs, I'd be happy to pay.
en-unannotated-05023	I am a long time fan of the Capital Grille and the Mexico City location didn't disappoint.
en-unannotated-05024	then will they look poor and the poor players are getting bullied each year in roblox (cyberbullying) by the rich player just because they have no robux.
en-unannotated-05025	We dined at Arzak as a result of a chance meeting with fellow New Zealanders in San Sebastián in October 2015. They had made a group booking some seven months previously and two of their group had had to withdraw.
en-unannotated-05026	Great hotel with large and very confortable rooms (remark: choose shopping mal side, street side can be noisy in the morning from 5), friendly staff and great breakfast (remark: water is not available at buffet)
en-unannotated-05027	We had lunch here and it was splendid with great service and authentic Irish bartenders.
en-unannotated-05028	Hey hey what happened with all my downloaded music?
en-unannotated-05029	Dirty, toilet water leaking, paint chip over our headboard.
en-unannotated-05030	Hotel is spotless and has a modern feel.
en-unannotated-05031	Service, comfort, location were all excellent.
en-unannotated-05032	Absolutely delicious!
en-unannotated-05033	Environment: Great view on a a day with beautiful weather.
en-unannotated-05034	We come to the restaurant in March and it was probably half full in the evening but the atmosphere was good and you could hear yourself speak.
en-unannotated-05035	The food was great.
en-unannotated-05036	This is the perfect combination of a real Irish pub and a trendy "cool" bar.
en-unannotated-05037	Classical light room largely opened on a garden flowered and sported.
en-unannotated-05038	Great ambiance, friendly staff and a fantastic place to go!
en-unannotated-05039	I ordered from the prefix menu which I highly recommend.
en-unannotated-05040	The atmosphere is inviting and trendy.
en-unannotated-05041	We are facing problems weekends .
en-unannotated-05042	The ingredients were primarily organic, and everything was fresh, flavorful, well-portioned, and so worth every penny and more.
en-unannotated-05043	No issues other than script font changes when accessing from my laptop after updating an appointment on my phone.
en-unannotated-05044	Tasty!
en-unannotated-05045	Impress friends/dates by leading them down a laneway to Survey.
en-unannotated-05046	LOVE 9 ball pool just need to be able to challenge friends now!!
en-unannotated-05047	Reception was quick and efficient.
en-unannotated-05048	We stayed in this hotel twice during our ten-day trip in May 2017. The first time, our room on the 10th floor became noisy at around 7pm every evening when the discos on the street below start blaring their music.
en-unannotated-05049	Nazi salute??
en-unannotated-05050	Go for double pattie to ensure the correct Burger 2 Bun ratio.
en-unannotated-05051	There is now and again a restaurant that you come across or stumble upon that surpasses all your hopes and expectations and for me DStage was the one for us in Madrid.
en-unannotated-05052	Our suite was ready early as we arrived at 8 AM.
en-unannotated-05053	The property, although still being renovated/established, is very clean and comfortable.
en-unannotated-05054	The clientele is a good mix of Parisians and tourists.
en-unannotated-05055	We ate here during our visits to the plage d'Arone , the fresh fish is good , the pasta is good , the burgers are good , the service is friendly , nice wines , clean toilets and 'mention spéciale' for the 'pasta à l'encre...
en-unannotated-05056	Another pint on Murphy's Irish Red.
en-unannotated-05057	And to pair it with truffle mashed potatoes and caramelized Brussel sprouts and bacon.
en-unannotated-05058	thats a start lol.
en-unannotated-05059	Location!
en-unannotated-05060	They make amazing croissants filled with ricotta, chocolate or pistachio.
en-unannotated-05061	It is enough to share (between 2) if you're too full and just want a taste, but trust me you will want more.
en-unannotated-05062	With that being said, this is a must try and it was one of my favorite meals in Paris.
en-unannotated-05063	Plus, it doesn't cater to Americans.
en-unannotated-05064	Perfect burgers, you can choose if you want chicken or beef but both is perfect!
en-unannotated-05065	We stumbled on this place for breakfast....
en-unannotated-05066	Love the game.
en-unannotated-05067	I loved it and would return and order the same thing.
en-unannotated-05068	a lot.
en-unannotated-05069	but Slither is the best I have it on my home screen right now.
en-unannotated-05070	The hotel team helped win everything.
en-unannotated-05071	Recommend.
en-unannotated-05072	Traditional food with a great variety and reasonably priced.
en-unannotated-05073	Charles and his team could not have made us feel more welcome and the food and service were out of this world.
en-unannotated-05074	Service is excellent.
en-unannotated-05075	We have been to Paris 5 times and dinner with "Dili gastronomy" has been the best event period.
en-unannotated-05076	My Lord was it amazing!!!
en-unannotated-05077	of cold meats and mixed green salad (€15.00)
en-unannotated-05078	The experience in this tea room is worth the slight expense.
en-unannotated-05079	It was an excellent choice.
en-unannotated-05080	It's served in a fresh bread bowl.
en-unannotated-05081	Big mistake.
en-unannotated-05082	Also I love the new updates (paddle, fidget spinner, bling). Please continue making more updates!
en-unannotated-05083	I like the live feature and the app has a good few options of what you can catch up on.
en-unannotated-05084	But, the older gentlemen server was unapologetic and didn't even look at us when we exited the restaurant.
en-unannotated-05085	may be uncomfortable to some.
en-unannotated-05086	g.
en-unannotated-05087	The bed was comfy and i had a good nights sleep.
en-unannotated-05088	Homey.
en-unannotated-05089	Excellent location lovely charming "old school hotel". Stayed here as a teenager 30 years ago so was a bit of a trip down memory lane.
en-unannotated-05090	I took a walk through the place and there are multiple rooms there was bars inside.
en-unannotated-05091	4. Location.
en-unannotated-05092	We stopped at this place around 1 in the afternoon for lunch.
en-unannotated-05093	A group of four men just got up and left.
en-unannotated-05094	We chose La Cordonerrie for our last dinner in Paris during our 10-day vacation to the City of Lights.
en-unannotated-05095	My girlfriend and I had the chance to stop by La Tena under the recommendation of a friend of hers and it didn't disappoint us at all.
en-unannotated-05096	We were struggling to get the Wi fi ,tv also was no friendly .
en-unannotated-05097	It most certainly did not.
en-unannotated-05098	Delicious food.
en-unannotated-05099	We chose this as one of the less expensive fine dining restaurants in San Sebastian/Donastia.
en-unannotated-05100	Loved the position of hotel Londres ...
en-unannotated-05101	This was paired with a glass of Burgundy that the server recommended to go with my dishes.
en-unannotated-05102	Never had this problem before until now.
en-unannotated-05103	Do yourself a favor and go to another place.
en-unannotated-05104	I perhaps expected better plumbing/insulation from the sound..
en-unannotated-05105	Highly recommend this hotel.
en-unannotated-05106	He still seated us and provided us with water and bread to start.
en-unannotated-05107	This is spam
en-unannotated-05108	In addition to menu items the bar counter had large plates of delectable savory baked pastries, some meat and some vegetarian.
en-unannotated-05109	For my main course I had the steak which was also good, it lacked a little seasoning for my taste but flavor of the meat was good.
en-unannotated-05110	Try the daily specials!
en-unannotated-05111	Saw this sweet place on our walk to the Guinness Storehouse and knew we had to stop by.
en-unannotated-05112	I came here a year ago, and this place had the best risotto I have had in my life.
en-unannotated-05113	Me and three other friends came here for our last lunch in Barcelona, expected quite a lot given the previous good reviews.
en-unannotated-05114	The cushions on the terrace were soaking wet so there was no way you were going to enjoy the terrace.
en-unannotated-05115	I was a little surprised when my dish came out because I was expecting actual dumplings, but it turns out potato and bread dumplings look like normal small pieces of bread.
en-unannotated-05116	The waitress was fab.
en-unannotated-05117	Want to eat fresh pasta in a lovely Milan streat?
en-unannotated-05118	so juicy and delicious.
en-unannotated-05119	Absolutely crap, you can only watch live shows, unable to catch up on anything
en-unannotated-05120	Traditional Spanish fare delivered in a spectacularly untraditional manner.
en-unannotated-05121	The rest of their menu looked interesting, and I would've gone back if I had the time.
en-unannotated-05122	It is certainly the best of the sea front restaurants we visited
en-unannotated-05123	We were introduced to this place by friends then we returned...
en-unannotated-05124	She handed us menus and we sat down to decide.
en-unannotated-05125	Every time ive used the app it hasnt worked properly and I couldnt sucessfully get a taxi.
en-unannotated-05126	We stopped to grab a bite here.
en-unannotated-05127	I ordered a toast were I had the possibility to decide...
en-unannotated-05128	Food: Their menu is super cute and comes within a vinyl record backing.
en-unannotated-05129	Nice detail I must say.
en-unannotated-05130	I would advise anyone visiting Paris to come here!!!!
en-unannotated-05131	Many of the tables are 'community' style, so don't expect great intimacy.
en-unannotated-05132	very delicious,,,, ate too much.
en-unannotated-05133	The hotel is rated as a 5* However the hotel is pretty dated needs some serious work doing to it in parts.
en-unannotated-05134	Do NOT install- go to Bumble or Badoo.
en-unannotated-05135	amazing and heaping starter charcuterie platter followed by a great seafood ravioli and a pig cheek main, perfectly done.
en-unannotated-05136	The (obviously French) onion soup was magnifique!
en-unannotated-05137	Easy walk from station.
en-unannotated-05138	Bed ok but pillows too hard to sleep on
en-unannotated-05139	I definitely recommmend this spot for those looking for an authentic french meal that is both satisfying and appropriately priced.
en-unannotated-05140	- egg and foie gras: 5/5. a MUST try!
en-unannotated-05141	For dessert they made...
en-unannotated-05142	Make it more complex and maybe people would be willing to pay for it
en-unannotated-05143	Cozy and affordable
en-unannotated-05144	A rare combination of good food, the right amount of friendly service, and a comfortable environment makes this place worth trying.
en-unannotated-05145	Couldn't finish it.
en-unannotated-05146	From the moment you enter this place you feel you are going back to colonial times.
en-unannotated-05147	This time I ordered fish a la tapenade, which, if you like olives as much as I do, I'd recommend you...
en-unannotated-05148	Angelo, 12 minutes to Trevi Fountain...
en-unannotated-05149	This year we stayed in room 303.
en-unannotated-05150	:)
en-unannotated-05151	Everything we had was excellent on the tasting menu.
en-unannotated-05152	Unfortunately this food was very disappointing and even though the waitress confirmed our order we didn't get what we had asked for.
en-unannotated-05153	I like the location of this hotel, and I like the fact that it is very heritage place...
en-unannotated-05154	The menu is quite extensive and impressive, and changes frequently to avoid becoming stale.
en-unannotated-05155	Our two entrees were equally as amazing; we ordered the duck confit shepherds pie and the au gratin potatoes with smoked duck breast.
en-unannotated-05156	Service was also very good.
en-unannotated-05157	Other than having to buy the rest of the levels , it's a great game.
en-unannotated-05158	Atmosphere: cosy and quiet, great view on the sea
en-unannotated-05159	Spices, toppings and sauces were sparse - you could really taste the freshness of the meat.
en-unannotated-05160	...i'm still finding to copy your Mediterranean menu, for my wife.
en-unannotated-05161	If you are used to American steak dinners - you might want to consider something else, unless you know you like French style steaks.
en-unannotated-05162	Overall, an excellent restaurant with phenomenal food for excellent prices outside of the tourist trap of city center.
en-unannotated-05163	Dinner at Farm a few time.
en-unannotated-05164	Very unique ambiance,
en-unannotated-05165	1) Location of this hotel is near by beach
en-unannotated-05166	Our group of four found the restaurant on our way to a nearby cocktail bar and checked on their availability.
en-unannotated-05167	We were staying at Les Dames du Pantheon so it is a very short walk to the restaurant.
en-unannotated-05168	Mmm!
en-unannotated-05169	I also found it really amusing that they give you a "beer card" so that they can mark down how many beers you had and pay at the end of the night.
en-unannotated-05170	This room had no dresser to put our clothes.
en-unannotated-05171	The low light levels, exposed pipes and brickwork gives an element of industrial grunge yet still feeling comfortable and cosy.
en-unannotated-05172	Alone or with friends, afternoon or evening.
en-unannotated-05173	When we were there, we had a few options for the entree, and for the plat there was a quinoa salad with gambas, a pork dish, and a chicken dish with cannelonis.
en-unannotated-05174	Everything was delicious.
en-unannotated-05175	I can easily place my meal at Matiz in my "top five" meals of all time.
en-unannotated-05176	I'm kind of disappointed.
en-unannotated-05177	I had the duck breast with blueberry sauce and I was a bit disappointed by how little duck they gave...
en-unannotated-05178	Plenty of restaurants near by for local food.
en-unannotated-05179	As great as all the reviews promise!
en-unannotated-05180	Portions are large!
en-unannotated-05181	The music is also extraordinary.
en-unannotated-05182	Aweeeesome!
en-unannotated-05183	I don't think you can find a much better deal in Paris, especially if you're looking to dive into some authentic French food.
en-unannotated-05184	You feel like in the UK.
en-unannotated-05185	Good food, few pints of Aspall cider and I was happy.
en-unannotated-05186	We ordered 2 starters and an hamburger!
en-unannotated-05187	Excellent meal at a great price.
en-unannotated-05188	The true sense of Roma the hotel provides
en-unannotated-05189	The food is all freshly cooked and tastes great would recommend every time.
en-unannotated-05190	Student stay, very nice hotel and accommodations.
en-unannotated-05191	Avoid 40 euros pp breakfast at get it better and cheaper a few metters around
en-unannotated-05192	It was full but the nice lady knows exactly what is happening in the restaurant and we've got two places in under ten minutes.
en-unannotated-05193	I don't mind sharing, but it's definitely not necessarily a good spot for a date night.
en-unannotated-05194	I've never had a better version of these two items in my life!
en-unannotated-05195	Great for a date or a boys night or a girls night or a whatever nice, seriously you could come here for everything and anything.
en-unannotated-05196	This place is really, really popular with Americans for some reason.
en-unannotated-05197	It was not my first stay with them and I did not regret going a second time.
en-unannotated-05198	Or just hungry?
en-unannotated-05199	Modern hotel, with good service.
en-unannotated-05200	What fabulous food, company and a lovely venue.
en-unannotated-05201	Outstanding manager's reception - full drink menu and excellent appetizers.
en-unannotated-05202	3) breakfast was not included in our booking,they were serving it at 7.7euro per head.
en-unannotated-05203	My friend and I stayed for 5nights on a city break.
en-unannotated-05204	Choices include edamame, seared scallop tostada, truffled salami, Roquefort ravioli and roast spatchcock, highlighting the vast styles on offer.
en-unannotated-05205	This was truly one of my favorite dining experiences ever.
en-unannotated-05206	No frills but just outside the restaurant there were tons of stickers showing their accolades for the food they serve so that was a good sign.
en-unannotated-05207	Our meal of one appetizer, two entrees, one dessert, and a bottle of wine amounted to $70 total but if you took the prices off the menu I would have thought our meal was at least double.
en-unannotated-05208	It's located a bit out of the way, but close to the M1 line and so worth the trip.
en-unannotated-05209	App works fine on my ipad but i am experiencing the same problems as the reviewers below on my Samsung S6.
en-unannotated-05210	We got a table, ordered drinks, & chilled for a while until we could order food so we really got to enjoy the ambiance of this quaint & cozy restaurant.
en-unannotated-05211	Also, it's probably better to hold off on dinner reservations until 7:30 or later on a Friday or Saturday night if you're not starving.
en-unannotated-05212	The owner and his wife came to our table, took selfies with us, recommended wine, and made us feel so welcome.
en-unannotated-05213	Opting for the tasting menu, together with a caviar tasting, and the staffs' choice of wines was an...
en-unannotated-05214	It is located in the best area of Bogota.
en-unannotated-05215	This restaurant captures this welcoming and cozy environment by it's petite size which truly makes the dining experience into more of a communal gathering, whether that was or was not the intention of the restaurant.
en-unannotated-05216	Too bad I'm not still around to give them a second try.
en-unannotated-05217	So memorable!
en-unannotated-05218	You could see lots of locals...
en-unannotated-05219	The broken shower.
en-unannotated-05220	Tasting menu left me feeling comfortably full.
en-unannotated-05221	I would love to jump back into it, and experience something new that isn't Toad Rally.
en-unannotated-05222	I had the chicken breast with a pea purée, with carrots and potato.
en-unannotated-05223	cute place for breakfast, it's right in the city center, you can stop by to grab a bite and then continue walking around.
en-unannotated-05224	I loved the bread bags and the presentation of the food was lovely to look at.
en-unannotated-05225	I was greeted graciously at the door and seated at a table near the window.
en-unannotated-05226	Coffee: nice coffee to top it all off and get us on our way.
en-unannotated-05227	Went here for after work drinks and dinner on Friday night.
en-unannotated-05228	Little bit pricey, but not too bad.
en-unannotated-05229	We have eaten the meatloaf, hamburger, and sausage which were all excellent.
en-unannotated-05230	My friend loved her spinach and pork pancake, and we both loved our dessert pancakes (I had the key lime one that tastes like key lime pie, and she had the lindt chocolate with banana.
en-unannotated-05231	To start try the fresh sweet bread with nata and a warm hot chocolate.
en-unannotated-05232	Not bad, but out of all the places I went to in Italy, this place only ranked okay.
en-unannotated-05233	Burgers and chips were fantastic (though they forgot one of my ingredients). The short fall for me is that after spending $50 on two burgers and two beers - they wanted to charge me 70 cents for ketchup for my Fries.
en-unannotated-05234	They were turning away anyone wo a reservation.
en-unannotated-05235	Other: The music is awesome if you like bands like The National and Bon Iver.
en-unannotated-05236	Maybe I must-stop if...
en-unannotated-05237	The third dish I got was grilled octopus.
en-unannotated-05238	The burgers are filling, and the tables make for great people watching with a nice, leisure lunch in perfect weather!
en-unannotated-05239	The menu has quite a few yummy things to choose from.
en-unannotated-05240	Unfortunately it was so good that it made my expectations alot higher for other restaurants.
en-unannotated-05241	Non vegans will equally appreciate the subtlety and sophistication of her food.
en-unannotated-05242	Absolutely delicious, and fresh flavours and food.
en-unannotated-05243	Good classic tapas with old timers.
en-unannotated-05244	If you were to stumble upon Peklo or even if you are reading this review and planning a visit, then my recommendation is to pop in for a beer or two or three or even more if your ability to smell is terrible or is broken or you don't mind sitting in a musty cave.
en-unannotated-05245	Their...
en-unannotated-05246	As a party of three, we all ordered something different and were equally impressed with each dish.
en-unannotated-05247	Excellent location
en-unannotated-05248	The portions are big and if you want to share with a friend, they split the meal for you before bringing it out which was really nice!
en-unannotated-05249	The last night we were there, Friday, May 12, we had to get up early the next morning and there was a loud garden party going in.
en-unannotated-05250	It was packed, with crowds spilling out into the lobby when we arrived for brunch.
en-unannotated-05251	Looking forward to returning to our favorite little Parisian spot on our next trip.
en-unannotated-05252	It was an intimate environment.
en-unannotated-05253	Enjoyed my stay and will be staying there on my next trip.
en-unannotated-05254	The sundried...
en-unannotated-05255	My husband and I spent two weeks in Barcelona and dinner at [name] and [name]'s was hands down the highlight of our trip.
en-unannotated-05256	The soup came with some homemade bread that was to die for!
en-unannotated-05257	Breakfast was great - fresh and variety.
en-unannotated-05258	Very tender and the potatoes were a very nice compliment.
en-unannotated-05259	Prices much lower than the USA.
en-unannotated-05260	My steak was good, it grew on me as I ate - needed a bit of salt - and it really doesn't compare to a steak dinner in Texas - but it had very good flavor and was tender.
en-unannotated-05261	Duck: We asked for medium and it came out pretty bloody.
en-unannotated-05262	Spent my last ten days in Italy and wanted to share the best places I've been to.
en-unannotated-05263	Context: Have had lunch and dinner here over a dozen times.
en-unannotated-05264	thankfully I had brought mine.
en-unannotated-05265	I'm unsure if I'd be back again.
en-unannotated-05266	we both ordered a burger - medium rare.
en-unannotated-05267	Amazing food and drinks, great service and a fantastic view.
en-unannotated-05268	Small but delicious menu - yogurt, granola, chia pudding, coronation chicken sandwich, smashed avocado on toast and poached eggs.
en-unannotated-05269	The food was well thought out and well balanced, and you can tell that they use high quality ingredients.
en-unannotated-05270	The room has very small, not at all what was advertised.
en-unannotated-05271	Staff is really friendly and helpful.
en-unannotated-05272	The macaroons were better than I expected!!!!
en-unannotated-05273	Ramoni , the girl working there it is helpful,all pending, multilingual-so no communication problems.
en-unannotated-05274	The service was nice, and the waiters knew English and had an English menu so that was a bonus!
en-unannotated-05275	All aspects of stay exceeded expectations.
en-unannotated-05276	You will leave boozy, happy and with filled tummies.
en-unannotated-05277	My god the beef goulash is good.
en-unannotated-05278	This was followed by a...
en-unannotated-05279	The place is buzzing, quite where all these people go that you see walking in the front door I have no idea, the food that the staff were whizzing by with looked excellent and people eating the food looked very happy.
en-unannotated-05280	This restaurant is right next to Old Town Square and is definitely worth a visit!
en-unannotated-05281	I was very impressed with the whole lobby area, bar, etc on the main floor.
en-unannotated-05282	Because it is a great time killer.
en-unannotated-05283	The steaks were generous & delicious.
en-unannotated-05284	The cream was way too heavy though.
en-unannotated-05285	The staff are friendly and speak English and the food is simply delicious.
en-unannotated-05286	We had coffee and pastries and they were...
en-unannotated-05287	I opted for the pork chop, wife for the beef with creme sauce and dumplings.
en-unannotated-05288	Crispy not greasy.
en-unannotated-05289	I didn't enjoy the pork dish.
en-unannotated-05290	This game is great.
en-unannotated-05291	The coffee was great too - you can tell they use quality beans.
en-unannotated-05292	Just a shame about the lack of monitoring customers at tables.
en-unannotated-05293	I decided to go here since there were good review on TripAdvisor.
en-unannotated-05294	We ate here on our last night in Paris and had a memorable meal for all of the right reasons.
en-unannotated-05295	Staff was friendly and atmosphere great.
en-unannotated-05296	I can't recommend this place enough.
en-unannotated-05297	this is hard to find, especially on this side of the river.
en-unannotated-05298	It's incredibly strange for me because in the past couple of weeks I did not have this problem.
en-unannotated-05299	- steak fillet: 2/5. Skip!
en-unannotated-05300	The first thing that surprised me was that it did not have a proper portal.
en-unannotated-05301	The vitello was sent from God or even better from my granpa.
en-unannotated-05302	Reasonable location and close to airport.
en-unannotated-05303	5 stars for ambiance, service and the coffee but 4 stars for the food (which in my book is still above average). We literally walked past this place 4 times trying to find it.
en-unannotated-05304	5
en-unannotated-05305	Service was fast and friendly.
en-unannotated-05306	Only location but there's a lot better hotels the same location
en-unannotated-05307	) and a finger food appetizer of shrimp and mango purée over cucumbers..
en-unannotated-05308	The food here is delicious.
en-unannotated-05309	Found this on TripAdvisor and thought to give it a try because we were visiting the Sagrada Familia and heading to Parc Guell on foot and this was on the way.
en-unannotated-05310	I found the entrance area nice and also small.
en-unannotated-05311	Generous portions.
en-unannotated-05312	Not my favorite place to eat in Milan.
en-unannotated-05313	We were in Bogota for the Peace Summit and visited this restaurant because it was close to our hotel.
en-unannotated-05314	Decided to try it out on a cuff.
en-unannotated-05315	I guess I'd expect something else than a frozen pizza in Italy.
en-unannotated-05316	I visited Dublin over 7 years ago and still remember my meal here.
en-unannotated-05317	Hitler?
en-unannotated-05318	Spaghetti was okay but some noodles were under or overcooked somehow.
en-unannotated-05319	It must not have been very long, and the lighting in the meat fridge made it hard to tell if a steak was red or brown...
en-unannotated-05320	Again...
en-unannotated-05321	no fridge .
en-unannotated-05322	Not sure why we went in but I'm glad we did.
en-unannotated-05323	Here's what we had:
en-unannotated-05324	The front desk staff is incredibly nice and helpful, especially Adrienne.
en-unannotated-05325	For dessert we decided to go with the "laneway cones" (to share), of raspberry, salted caramel, chocolate ($12) & an additional cone $4. The cones stacked in a bowl of fried, choc powder & specks of raw sugar.
en-unannotated-05326	A beautiful Madrid day made better by relaxing on rooftop terrace.
en-unannotated-05327	I wish I could give you an accurate description of how good it was, but the only thing that would do it some sort of justice is to say that it was out of this world.
en-unannotated-05328	Claims to be Ireland's oldest bar- you can actually feel like you are going back in time when you walk in.
en-unannotated-05329	We picked it because we had stayed before for a couple of days when it was a Radisson hotel and it has a pool.
en-unannotated-05330	Bistrot L'Estrapade is a treasure.
en-unannotated-05331	Nicely decorated.
en-unannotated-05332	It had a lovely spice to it aswell.
en-unannotated-05333	Period.
en-unannotated-05334	The food is amazing, ask for their recommended menu, you'll never be disappointed.
en-unannotated-05335	One of the most incredible meals ever.
en-unannotated-05336	The hotel is one of the best in Bogota, but that is not the same as expensive, in fact the Hotel is very affordable and the suites are beautiful, clean and with a great view.
en-unannotated-05337	For my plat, I could only choose the salad, as I eat seafood but no meat, but unfortunately by the time we ordered they had run out!
en-unannotated-05338	Initially we stayed at an older room but asked front desk to change and without hesitation we received a beautiful room.
en-unannotated-05339	Great place with great food!!
en-unannotated-05340	For being located right on the old town square, the food was remarkably not too expensive.
en-unannotated-05341	restaurant awesome with RIOJA included!!
en-unannotated-05342	P.Mac's is a lovely pub a mere stones trow away from Stevens Green shopping mall.
en-unannotated-05343	My hubs had the butternut squash linguini and it was complex and delightful.
en-unannotated-05344	Huge, but still very easy to access.
en-unannotated-05345	It's a decent hotel, but nothing special for $167 a night and that's with a AAA discount.
en-unannotated-05346	If there was upgrades and actual logins so that you can go on your account so your snake is the same as you left it, it would be more exciting.
en-unannotated-05347	We also ordered cappuccinos and an extra side of scrambled eggs for 20 czk (i think) but we definitely did not need the eggs!
en-unannotated-05348	Well how would I make it short, outstanding , sexy, profesional , welcoming , tasty, creative.....
en-unannotated-05349	The library is on the second floor and it's unique and elegant....
en-unannotated-05350	One of my long time faves!
en-unannotated-05351	And it was!
en-unannotated-05352	No ifs or buts.
en-unannotated-05353	The duck was ample in size and was prepared in many ways.

en-unannotated-05361	We went after we saw many reviews in trip advisor which never disappoint.
en-unannotated-05362	The staff were nice and efficient, the food was incredible and the owner was so friendly and made you feel like family!
en-unannotated-05363	This small restaurant is located amongst many others which, according to Yelp, are pretty much tourist traps, that's why I picked this one :)
en-unannotated-05364	For 16,000 cop terrific stuff.
en-unannotated-05365	Both really good.
en-unannotated-05366	Plus local butchers are like a walking encyclopedias of meat :-) You just tell them what you wanna cook and they will tell you the best options and how to do cook it the best.
en-unannotated-05367	bah I feel like if it was clear that (language barrier) we could not order everything on menu we would have kept looking.
en-unannotated-05368	We are mad about Madrid and never visit without dining with the Ladies from Rioja on our first night.
en-unannotated-05369	Food is average at best.
en-unannotated-05370	Service was otherwise ok.
en-unannotated-05371	Is fairly close to the airport and is also easy access to downtown and La Candelaria.
en-unannotated-05372	Tucked away in a quiet little street in the Right Bank, this place oozes charm.
en-unannotated-05373	You can opt for their 7 or 10 or 17 courses menu.
en-unannotated-05374	It tiny place that could be missed if you blink.
en-unannotated-05375	Highly recommend going around the corner from the hotel to a local cafe called sette grammi - excellent sunny spot with amazing coffees, pastries, cakes and sandwiches.
en-unannotated-05376	Nothing was too much trouble, great welcome, great value, great hotel.
en-unannotated-05377	One of the best values we've found so far in Paris.
en-unannotated-05378	Absolute heaven.
en-unannotated-05379	Wont open, keeps shutting down when i go to watch anything.
en-unannotated-05380	I enjoyed a flourless chocolate torte and he had cheesecake for dessert.

en-unannotated-05382	Chicken is also a must.
en-unannotated-05383	Really welcoming personnel.
en-unannotated-05384	Pointless app
en-unannotated-05385	I wanted to eat here everyday while in Brisbane!
en-unannotated-05386	Definitely try the tinga tostada.
en-unannotated-05387	It's our secret!
en-unannotated-05388	It was so delicious and savory.
en-unannotated-05389	My favorites were the peanut butter and jelly pancakes, and the prosciutto and cherry tomato pancakes.
en-unannotated-05390	The restaurant itself is quite small, but hella cute and cozy.
en-unannotated-05391	The hotel was across the street from a bar/restaurant, so you didn't have to travel to eat/drink if you didn't want to.
en-unannotated-05392	A restaurant with a young crew, there is no choise in menu, and three choises in foodpairing drinks.
en-unannotated-05393	Delicious food and very good service a must if you stop by Bogota.
en-unannotated-05394	Oh wow, wow wow wow.
en-unannotated-05395	Super fun to play regardless of the 'boring' controlls.
en-unannotated-05396	* dress up!
en-unannotated-05397	One of the staff was lying down on the SOFA of the lobby, and was inattentive to our needs.
en-unannotated-05398	We started off with Edamame as well as pork belly with apple kimchi sauce in soft tacos.
en-unannotated-05399	Kitchen is a good size and the laundry facilities are also fantastic.
en-unannotated-05400	Cannot see the map and yes it is angering to keep pushing tip driver.
en-unannotated-05401	And the manager said it is only a design.
en-unannotated-05402	Roasted bone marrow?
en-unannotated-05403	Wonderful food.
en-unannotated-05404	We were expecting fresh orange juice but it was straight from a carton.

en-unannotated-05409	We ate here lunch and enjoyed Creative, innovative surprising food, without having to break your piggy bank.
en-unannotated-05410	The game stated I had 7 days to reach a certain level, I reached it in 2 days, but have never received the coins.
en-unannotated-05411	I always thought it was a great thing to have a busy restaurant.
en-unannotated-05412	The building itself is magical, location in central Rome is perfect.
en-unannotated-05413	We had a fun time doing this.
en-unannotated-05414	I sat outside on the terrace- it was very lively; a good atmosphere.
en-unannotated-05415	My boyfriend got the steak, which was okay, but very fatty.
en-unannotated-05416	If you're looking for something to convince you that there are still cool places in Brisbane, Verve is the place for you!
en-unannotated-05417	About €2 Euro a slice but the slices were huge!
en-unannotated-05418	Our first night in Prague we tried this restaurant.
en-unannotated-05419	Overall great choice in Dublin!
en-unannotated-05420	They basically have their own take on meat on top of chips with dips....
en-unannotated-05421	El Cardenal is located in a Hilton, but don’t let that mislead you.
en-unannotated-05422	We visited on a Saturday at 3:00 and were able to get a table with no wait.
en-unannotated-05423	In addition, no working internet.
en-unannotated-05424	Do not go they don't deserve the business not matter how good the food is.
en-unannotated-05425	We had just parked our car near the Town Hall and noticed this little restaurant: my husband had been longing for mussels the entire day and it is the eve of his birthday.
en-unannotated-05426	After a long, hot day of sightseeing in Prague, we stumbled upon Restaurace Mincovna right off of Old Town.
en-unannotated-05427	Find best bakery and deliver it directly to your table.
en-unannotated-05428	Home style French cuisines were served with full sets of foods, deserts, drinks, wines, titbits, various sauces, refreshment.
en-unannotated-05429	My wife and I recently left our summer apartment in Paris .
en-unannotated-05430	We were completely satisfied with the thing that mean the most to us: cleanliness, comfort, staff relations with us.
en-unannotated-05431	The food and champers delicious.
en-unannotated-05432	This restaurant reminded me of...
en-unannotated-05433	Menu limited and expensive.
en-unannotated-05434	We had the grautin which was amazing.
en-unannotated-05435	it was so worth it.
en-unannotated-05436	The definite favorite was the pesto dip and we weren't too sure about the other two.
en-unannotated-05437	the staff from beginning to end was exceptional ;
en-unannotated-05438	They also have an array of board games.
en-unannotated-05439	We spent three nights in Prague, and Naše Maso was on our list of eats based on its high rating on Yelp.
en-unannotated-05440	Mussolini?
en-unannotated-05441	Never had problems with hailo Bring back hailo!!!
en-unannotated-05442	However, our confusion was quickly dissuaded by a warm and enthusiastic greeting from the barista who informed us that we could sit anywhere and took our initial coffee orders.
en-unannotated-05443	choice of three for each course.
en-unannotated-05444	The real coffee, would say THE COFFEE in Moscow, plus fresh tasty croissants and baked delicious cakes.
en-unannotated-05445	This is a cozy bistro in the Marais with great food.
en-unannotated-05446	The waiter will give you a plate...
en-unannotated-05447	Secondly we got a raspberry French cake of some sort that tasted very similar to cheesecake.
en-unannotated-05448	Regardless of where on the planet you may be, if there is a Capital Grille you will be hard pressed to find a better restaurant.
en-unannotated-05449	I don't like the snobbism of the staff, they need to learn to be friendly, working with multicultural clients that pays money, I think we do deserve a friendly atmosphere;
en-unannotated-05450	Fortunately, The Farm is something special.
en-unannotated-05451	I came in yesterday to have a burger, wearing a baggy shirt with a fitted hat, not really knowing what type of establishment this was only the reviews I've seen on TA.
en-unannotated-05452	Room was a great size, with a separate room for the kids.
en-unannotated-05453	An amazing restaurant with a down-to-earth chef and excellent restaurant staff.
en-unannotated-05454	This new restaurant lives up to the hype of the several other 5 star reviews!

en-unannotated-05460	Perfect location - easy walk to all sights, great food nearby, v friendly staff, character building
en-unannotated-05461	The pillows were as solid as rock...
en-unannotated-05462	If you go to a show that ends late at night, this is an ideal location as you can take the metro to Zocalo and walk to the hotel.
en-unannotated-05463	And as if that was not enough : they come deliver one after another by waitresses and waiter and park them all there, jars, yes 3 jars!
en-unannotated-05464	We only waited about 10 minutes, as people don't spend too much time sitting down.
en-unannotated-05465	If we're talking just cost, I can download 4 to 5 albums and still pay just $10 A month versus what would end up being $50 or more on iTunes.
en-unannotated-05466	We arrived early just before 6pm for our 6:30pm reservation and were told that although our table was ready, the restaurant wasn't open until 6pm but we were welcome to get a drink.
en-unannotated-05467	Loved the selection of fancy hot chocs although they were just infused with essential oils however great value considering.
en-unannotated-05468	Perhaps a replay / repeat feature added too.
en-unannotated-05469	the breakfast is also very good and tasty.
en-unannotated-05470	A quick yelp search showed this place with a ton of reviews and still 4.5 stars.
en-unannotated-05471	Very reasonably priced for very clean and new facilities.
en-unannotated-05472	To top it off, at some point liquid from a fish dish was spilled on my shirt and my jacket which was hanging on the back of my chair.
en-unannotated-05473	Yogurt read "fresh" but they gave us a jar.
en-unannotated-05474	We had a great evening, exceptional and creative food and wonderful people.
en-unannotated-05475	Would recommend most of all the "bomba...
en-unannotated-05476	Survey has a vintage theme which is nicely put together.
en-unannotated-05477	Absolutely worth it.
en-unannotated-05478	Corredo,they were extremely gentle!
en-unannotated-05479	App does not respond constantly.
en-unannotated-05480	Had a lovely meal at terra cotta, really recommend if you are visiting Propriano - in a league above other restaurants in the town
en-unannotated-05481	Walked in here as a solo diner with a bit of trepidation.
en-unannotated-05482	A hole in the wall in the middle of Queen street mall.
en-unannotated-05483	So delicious.
en-unannotated-05484	The experience starts right from the front entrance with a double staircase taking you up to the main level.
en-unannotated-05485	I must make a special to Anna who went above  and beyond to organise tours  train  tickets and give advice on where to go
en-unannotated-05486	We wish we could have joined in the fun.
en-unannotated-05487	A great lunch.
en-unannotated-05488	Also had the clams and mussels.
en-unannotated-05489	When we reached the place, I couldn't believe this was a restaurant, but I was in the Czech Republic, so I let my sense of adventure take over.
en-unannotated-05490	House wine, a Sangiovese these nights was very good, body, flavor & priced at €12.
en-unannotated-05491	Staff excellent Tommasso at reception  polite happy and always a smile Anna at Conceige so helpful beautiful woman who cares about her patrons at hotel
en-unannotated-05492	We recomend the Tasting Menu.
en-unannotated-05493	pretty sure this is overrated on Yelp...
en-unannotated-05494	It came with little fried bananas and mashed potatoes.
en-unannotated-05495	MMMMMMMM.....
en-unannotated-05496	Food is something that you need to experience yourself, there is no words to describe that.
en-unannotated-05497	Lovely and cozy room and nice setup within the hotel.
en-unannotated-05498	Steak: This was decent but nothing extraordinary.
en-unannotated-05499	When I went (around 8 pm on a Sunday) I was the only patron inside.
en-unannotated-05500	He was right!
en-unannotated-05501	try the burger..........
en-unannotated-05502	Being located close to the Bolshoi theatre, I wasn't sure if the restaurant would be over rated.
en-unannotated-05503	Fantastic dining experience!
en-unannotated-05504	This time, it was different.
en-unannotated-05505	As others have described, one stands in line, orders a drink and orders the tacos.
en-unannotated-05506	Service was exceptional...
en-unannotated-05507	Our server John was super friendly and seemed genuinely interested in getting to know us and asking where we're from.
en-unannotated-05508	I can only review their drinks (not food) but wow, was I impressed the Bank's cocktails.
en-unannotated-05509	Especially when you  can play with ur friends and families.
en-unannotated-05510	Accommodated my food allergies but results were a bit bland.
en-unannotated-05511	I love a hole in the wall coffee shop.
en-unannotated-05512	No where near as good as Hailo was.
en-unannotated-05513	OK, the food is fantastic here.
en-unannotated-05514	We ordered the foie gras ravioli and a piece of foie gras with some toast.
en-unannotated-05515	The menu changes each evening, so the entire menu is the special.
en-unannotated-05516	Absolutely amazing experience here.
en-unannotated-05517	Not one.
en-unannotated-05518	Such a great unassuming little place.
en-unannotated-05519	What a great spot!
en-unannotated-05520	My word that was some delicious food.
en-unannotated-05521	I tried the fish of the day which was Monk fish-I've never had it before but it was very delicious!!
en-unannotated-05522	The Brazen Head is the oldest pub in Dublin, and it has live music nearly every night of the week.
en-unannotated-05523	Both elevated the dish in terms of texture and depth; the seeds were a welcome crunch and the sour cream added smoothness and tanginess.
en-unannotated-05524	PS: I love Spotify and have been using it for year.
en-unannotated-05525	Anyway..
en-unannotated-05526	It was pricey so i wasnt all that happy but whether its down to personal taste or not its hard to say.
en-unannotated-05527	Half of it was just fat.
en-unannotated-05528	Named after the occupation of the lane's namesake, surveyor and explorer James Burnett, is restaurant The Survey Co.
en-unannotated-05529	Noisy and there is a smell of humit
en-unannotated-05530	We were there on a weekday night and the service was attentive and helpful.
en-unannotated-05531	I have ordered this dish all over France and it's always good.
en-unannotated-05532	The waiter apologized, claiming he was new, but we left hungry and disappointed.
en-unannotated-05533	The duck is fantastic although please be aware it's served medium rare - the way French natives like it.
en-unannotated-05534	Meeting [name] and [name] was a very good experience, the food was lovely prepared and delicious, and the wine was tasty and wonderfully represented.
en-unannotated-05535	More suitable for a traveling student.
en-unannotated-05536	My veil was extra tiny, thin, and oily.
en-unannotated-05537	This was the best meal I had in Paris recently.
en-unannotated-05538	To be fair to the Survey Co, the small portions ended up being just perfect - had we been sensible and just had an entree, main and dessert each, it would have been the perfect amount of food.
en-unannotated-05539	Not so special
en-unannotated-05540	The location very close to the Stazione Centrale, ensures a real sense of benvenuti for any traveler.
en-unannotated-05541	Again, my cod was pretty good but [NAME]'s lamb was melt in your mouth delicious.
en-unannotated-05542	Then we tried the purple risotto.
en-unannotated-05543	We stayed for 5 nights at Anoeta.
en-unannotated-05544	However, after ordering 4 mains and entrees, we then sat for an hour.
en-unannotated-05545	We love the fact that was authentic Mexican food and the services was great.
en-unannotated-05546	Food: 4.5 stars
en-unannotated-05547	From the complimentary amuse bouchée to the crab salad, escargot (best I have ever had - not too garlicky, rack of lamb with risotto and the duck.
en-unannotated-05548	Not to be boring we asked for a different pasta on night two.
en-unannotated-05549	Located near the center squares.
en-unannotated-05550	Service was great and you just pay at the front counter on your way out.
en-unannotated-05551	They were tasty, but probably not my favorites.
en-unannotated-05552	The pozole was wonderful as it was the quesadilla, guacamole and the other bits I ordered.
en-unannotated-05553	My husband and I stayed here for 10 nights and we have no complaints.
en-unannotated-05554	Good choice for Sunday night when almost everything is closed on Bogotá. The waiter Enrique was excellent, really doing his best to make is feel happy.
en-unannotated-05555	The hotel room was spacious, modern, clean & we enjoyed the palace view from our balcony.
en-unannotated-05556	The first beer we had here was INCREDIBLE.
en-unannotated-05557	Sushi is fresh and tasty!
en-unannotated-05558	Very surprising that the cooks let a dish like that walk out of the kitchen.
en-unannotated-05559	I pick The hot tuna poke bowl every time because I dont like questions.
en-unannotated-05560	and it'll taste like meat marinated in sea water.
en-unannotated-05561	Rudi was an excellent host and a fantastic chef.
en-unannotated-05562	and I just recently discovered this gem!
en-unannotated-05563	Attention to detail & utmost care for lively patrons.
en-unannotated-05564	Rudi and his assistance were friendly, tentative and most importantly the food and presentation were great!
en-unannotated-05565	Lilana, Veronica  e Kimberley  most gentle and wonderful people who took care of our room
en-unannotated-05566	The waiter said that it should be fine with this meat, and it was.
en-unannotated-05567	excellent English..
en-unannotated-05568	Located near la Gran Estacion mall with very confortable rooms, shuttle service to the airport is free every 30min.
en-unannotated-05569	We called at the last minute for reservation and got in pretty quick.
en-unannotated-05570	The view is great, the bar makes a mean French Martini and Caprioska, the wine list is pretty awesome, the service is great, the food delicious and the desert comes together like magic.
en-unannotated-05571	As we walked in with limited research my high waisted jeans and blazer didn't seem as classy as I'd once thought.
en-unannotated-05572	It deserves 5-star for ambiance and service, and 4 star for food.
en-unannotated-05573	The Front Desk, concierge and waiters are all friendly and efficient.
en-unannotated-05574	It was the cheapest pintxos place I went to in San Seb but also one of the best.
en-unannotated-05575	As a huge fan of Bunker Coffee Milton during my University Life, I was devastated that I wouldn't be able to continue my daily visit upon beginning work in the city, but then I discovered John Mills Himself.
en-unannotated-05576	Completed with chocolate lava cake.
en-unannotated-05577	Both food and service were amazing.
en-unannotated-05578	This hotel is in a perfect location central to all the sights in Madrid.
en-unannotated-05579	I love this place!
en-unannotated-05580	Quality of meals very good, breakfast excellent.
en-unannotated-05581	Great location very convenient for all the sites.
en-unannotated-05582	Went there for lunch and got a 3 course for 18euro and each dish was absolutely delicious!
en-unannotated-05583	Price is not great, at all.
en-unannotated-05584	Entrees $18 - 22 & Mains $28 - $38. Cocktails average $16, beers $8, & a bottle of 2012 Fasoli Gino Corte Sparkling wine only set us back $49. All this makes for a great night out.
en-unannotated-05585	Super cute spot in Brera!
en-unannotated-05586	coming from a day at EXpo2015 and shopping in Milan we just wanted to find a casual place for dinner.
en-unannotated-05587	Monsier Benjamin has a very, very limited selection of pastries but that's because they're focused on their specialty.
en-unannotated-05588	We liked it so much that we went again the next evening.
en-unannotated-05589	- I forget). For sure, the drizzle was not overly sweet nor vinaigry as how most American restaurants (even Michelin-rated ones) tend to prepare the liver.
en-unannotated-05590	We came back to this tiny, delicious and affordable restaurant in Paris.
en-unannotated-05591	Needs improvement mostly though the name hailo was cooler and app was better - hailo notified arrival better and the overall look and feel was nicer.
en-unannotated-05592	I love poppyseed in almost anything and I have baked with it, so I know when it is or isn't good.
en-unannotated-05593	My nephew had the veal Milanese.
en-unannotated-05594	Buy my main course was amazing - the casuela (? Spelling ). It was a seafood soup...
en-unannotated-05595	I attended this dinner party of 18 people together with my partner and we both had a fantastic time.
en-unannotated-05596	I loved this place!
en-unannotated-05597	Anyway, he was very attentive to us and gave us some recommendations for our beer flight.
en-unannotated-05598	We very much enjoyed our meal at Boxty House.
en-unannotated-05599	Everytime someone took a shower, flushed the toilet you hear it.
en-unannotated-05600	I love the way its setup and their cupcakes and brownies are great!
en-unannotated-05601	The one problem I have is that when my phone is on the rotation setting and I turn my phone across the way to get a bigger picture the app doesn't seem to accommodate the function please sort this  and I will give full stars Samsung note 3
en-unannotated-05602	really is crap.
en-unannotated-05603	Authentic food and local vibe with excellent pastas.
en-unannotated-05604	We remembered a european inspired menu from our last visit and now the menu has a strange mix of mexican and japanese and we found it hard to choose.
en-unannotated-05605	They smelled unfortunately and tasted just as bad.
en-unannotated-05606	I think the word has gotten out to my fellow Americans about this place.
en-unannotated-05607	Super value for room appearance - property appeal-- staff being friendly .
en-unannotated-05608	The candy treats are a cute touch too!
en-unannotated-05609	What a rude way to end a meal!!
en-unannotated-05610	After walking around the city after my exam on a Saturday, I was looking for a cute place to grab brunch with a friend and after failing to find something slightly appetizing she took me to Brew.
en-unannotated-05611	The owner is really down to earth and cool.
en-unannotated-05612	She is a sustainable greek so asked me to find something according.
en-unannotated-05613	Atmosphere of the old castle is amazing.
en-unannotated-05614	Highly recommend the Mezcal cocktail and salmon rice cake sashimi :)
en-unannotated-05615	I booked a room 4 months prior to my arrival, in the end my whole group was split up and I ultimately had to pay more in the end.
en-unannotated-05616	I got the beef tartare, I also tried the scallops and risotto (so good), escargots, and duck confit.
en-unannotated-05617	The only downside was that we could not control the AC and the room was too warm.
en-unannotated-05618	They know how to spoil you.
en-unannotated-05619	However, if I paid full price for the food I'd call it too expensive and possibly not worth the cost?
en-unannotated-05620	Hello, I leave reviews very rarely, but here it is especially important, because the mistakes are too obvious.
en-unannotated-05621	The hotel has sound proof windows, which work fine.
en-unannotated-05622	The last thing about this game that I like is that you can type whatever name you want!!
en-unannotated-05623	For my Dad's 70th I chose this seafood restaurant, as Dad loves his seafood.
en-unannotated-05624	The beer brewed at the monastery is fantastic (we liked the blueberry beer and normally I disdain blueberry beers). We sat outside with our toddler who happily played.
en-unannotated-05625	Would definitely come back.
en-unannotated-05626	All the staff were there to make sure you had a great time
en-unannotated-05627	This place is run by a few French guys that spoke perfect english and believe in excellent customer service.
en-unannotated-05628	It was a pleasure to learn more about French culture and what real...
en-unannotated-05629	The service here was so amazing too, which is why I'm giving it five stars.
en-unannotated-05630	and thus, we headed off to Eagle St :)
en-unannotated-05631	This is a great little hotel.
en-unannotated-05632	Love!
en-unannotated-05633	Very good value for money in beautiful condesa
en-unannotated-05634	Warmly recommended.
en-unannotated-05635	Menu changes a little every month or so.
en-unannotated-05636	A very nice little bar, managed by a charming couple and the grandma of one of them helping to cook nice little tapas.
en-unannotated-05637	However, when I do I like listening to music.
en-unannotated-05638	The food was tasty
en-unannotated-05639	Cooked with beet (I think with their translation) and crushed walnut.
en-unannotated-05640	:0 I wish they could improve this fact.
en-unannotated-05641	We had 5 girls and the 6 dishes below was the perfect amount of food for us.
en-unannotated-05642	The owner (I assume) was in and she was also super friendly and quirky.
en-unannotated-05643	The staff and the ambiance of the hotel makes staying pleasurable.
en-unannotated-05644	the rooms are awful, shower in the sleeping area, zero noise cancellation from the neighbouring rooms, smell of chlorine and cigarets.
en-unannotated-05645	We also walked further down to the Zocalo and to the cathedral.
en-unannotated-05646	I like this game because it is the best.
en-unannotated-05647	Everything we ordered was good, especially the oysters which we agreed were the best we have had in Brisbane.
en-unannotated-05648	It was also very conveniently located near our hotel (Londres).
en-unannotated-05649	Meaning recycled furniture with quasi-clean aesthetics.
en-unannotated-05650	The ravioli de oscar was just as good.
en-unannotated-05651	The Menu has a number of very creative and tasty dishes, harmonized with different wine, wonderful combinations of ingredients!
en-unannotated-05652	The room was very neat & clean & the bathroom had everything a traveler needs.
en-unannotated-05653	The equipments and furnitures at the hotel are very old and useless, dont think that place is historical.
en-unannotated-05654	Such a cute and friendly place with a delightful staff.
en-unannotated-05655	My wife had a chicken salad which I would describe as very "raw": while the meat was well cooked, the veggies were rough chopped and otherwise "unprocessed". I had some sausages and a small 0,3 L Pilsner Urquell.
en-unannotated-05656	Delicious mix of creamy, sour and not too sweet.
en-unannotated-05657	There is a fine dining restaurant and a snack area alongside.
en-unannotated-05658	Only a passing glance was had of the bar area, but it appeared much more open with an deck style arrangement.
en-unannotated-05659	Great spot for a quick bite and beer.
en-unannotated-05660	Restaurant is inside the JW Marriott.
en-unannotated-05661	All in all, you definitely can't go wrong with this place.
en-unannotated-05662	I recommend the authentic Czech dish of Roasted Pork Knee which is enough for two to share, with the house beer of choice, but I recommend the pilsners with the pork to cleanly cut through the sweetness and savory fatty juices if that only roast pork has.
en-unannotated-05663	We had breakfast here.
en-unannotated-05664	We were lucky enough to bag a reservation on the same day, but we're told the only seats left were 'kitchen tables'. We accepted on the basis of the reviews but assumed we'd missed out on the better seats.
en-unannotated-05665	There are ample chunks of beef and the flavor was wonderful.
en-unannotated-05666	Prepared with the local products, including the herbs, it is surely worth the detour.
en-unannotated-05667	I order the Beef and Guinness stew which was amazing!
en-unannotated-05668	Our professional tour guide recommended this restaurant to us as one that serves traditional Czech food, a bit lighter and with a real chef's flare.
en-unannotated-05669	However, the food wasn't great.
en-unannotated-05670	The owners are very warm and welcoming people - they go above and beyond to make sure all of their customers have a wonderful meal.
en-unannotated-05671	But reservations are a MUST at this gastronomical hotspot so book a few days in advance.
en-unannotated-05672	It was a very good evening, we had very good menu, it was delightful with good vines.
en-unannotated-05673	Pros: Quite new hotel, nice room, location
en-unannotated-05674	The location is very good, it is in a safe area, just few minutes walk to park 93 with lots of Restaurants, Cafe, Bars etc.
en-unannotated-05675	I miss P.Mac's already and can't wait to get back there this coming december.
en-unannotated-05676	And did we have to wait long?
en-unannotated-05677	There wasn't good wifi at all and kept telling us it will work soon but nothing happen
en-unannotated-05678	No tissues were in the room the only tissues they have is toilet papers..
en-unannotated-05679	Don't miss this place!
en-unannotated-05680	Wonderful experience!
en-unannotated-05681	We came after a long day of sightseeing and had the most delicious, memorable meal of our trip.
en-unannotated-05682	Friendly and warm service and attentive.
en-unannotated-05683	We loved every moment there!
en-unannotated-05684	The bananas paired well with the duck and the dish also comes with mash potatoes.
en-unannotated-05685	I don't often order pasta when out but this would be my exception.
en-unannotated-05686	Great place for a view of the Story Bridge.
en-unannotated-05687	Possibly.
en-unannotated-05688	Found this place with only 4 reviews on yelp but some other good reviews on Google.
en-unannotated-05689	They were super friendly and very helpful when ordering food.
en-unannotated-05690	This visit was Great!!!
en-unannotated-05691	Wonderful bar.
en-unannotated-05692	Pillows are like stone, bed is not comfortable at all but my friend and I managed to sleep because we we're too tired.
en-unannotated-05693	Excellent hotel.
en-unannotated-05694	Of course as expected it's in the higher price range but compared to others in this range The food, location and service are head and shoulders above.
en-unannotated-05695	When we walked in, there was an empty table available, and immediately after, a line of people formed outside and there was a 30 minute wait.
en-unannotated-05696	Will come again.
en-unannotated-05697	I'm going to Lokal again the next time I'm in Prague, which is soon (hint, hint).
en-unannotated-05698	I hope I can go but I also hope it's not as expensive as some of the reviews say it is.
en-unannotated-05699	Rooms are pretty clean and beautiful.
en-unannotated-05700	Best pasta in milan!
en-unannotated-05701	Only 5 minutes and they send you up in the lift.
en-unannotated-05702	We decided on Watermelon five ways which included a lime infused with watermelon juice (another special on that night) and a Chocolate Fondant with a white sesame ice cream.
en-unannotated-05703	I visited Mexico City this past memorial weekend from the U.S.  , and had the pleasure of staying at the Mexico City Marriott Reforma Hotel.
en-unannotated-05704	Its terrible.
en-unannotated-05705	I am totally impressed with this modern place in Polanco area.
en-unannotated-05706	The hotel was far from what we have expected.
en-unannotated-05707	While the burger was delicately soft and tender it somehow wasn't juicy like burgers over flame.
en-unannotated-05708	We ordered a cabbage salad, the chef's special, which is the pork knuckle and chicken soup.
en-unannotated-05709	Nothing was too difficult for the staff who were always pleasant and friendly.
en-unannotated-05710	Not only is the food locally sourced (which matters to many), organic in many cases (which matters to many more), but its presentation is pleasing to both the eye & your waiting gullet.
en-unannotated-05711	Air Con was broken at the first room the change another room with noisy ventilation sound in the bath room and not sufficient lighting in the rooms for the first night.
en-unannotated-05712	Run by a lovely couple.
en-unannotated-05713	Bruce Wayne by day, Batman by night.
en-unannotated-05714	It is small, but we were lucky to have a bit of room between our table and the next one.
en-unannotated-05715	public toilets downstairs were not clean
en-unannotated-05716	The tenth stamp lets you take a swing at the roulette mounted on the wall, where you can win some free food!
en-unannotated-05717	Waited 40 mins, didn't get served, so walked up to ask for our order.
en-unannotated-05718	Our entrees were delicious!
en-unannotated-05719	We found it!
en-unannotated-05720	The prosciutto and melon is a wonderful starter.
en-unannotated-05721	Came here after TripAdvisor told me it was number seven of 632 restaurants in San Sebastián.
en-unannotated-05722	rooms very dark
en-unannotated-05723	Super busy spot got a seat in the back between two English families.
en-unannotated-05724	Renowned Michelin-starred places may serve more...
en-unannotated-05725	Although there were only two servers for the whole (tiny) place (expect slow service), they were extremely friendly and patient.
en-unannotated-05726	I love the concept of this snake game.
en-unannotated-05727	I got back pain.
en-unannotated-05728	The place was empty and we tried to get a table and they wouldn't allow us in.
en-unannotated-05729	The tasting menu portion is smaller than the full portion (10 euro), which I almost wish I'd gotten so I could have more.
en-unannotated-05730	Service was superb.
en-unannotated-05731	First of all thank you [name] and [name], you can see in the dishes and service their passion what they are doing.
en-unannotated-05732	Definitely 'must try' in Paris.
en-unannotated-05733	ORDER THE CASSOULET
en-unannotated-05734	Gets really busy at weekends so better to go early.
en-unannotated-05735	I ordered the steak tartare and it was excellent.
en-unannotated-05736	We shared the boxty fries and they were amazing.
en-unannotated-05737	The egg, cheese, and arugula pancakes were probably my favorite, and we also ordered the bacon, avocado, and feta pancakes.
en-unannotated-05738	Super good taste but very dry.
en-unannotated-05739	Go here to grab a lunch, the burger wont disappoint you and you will most certainly be pleased walking away
en-unannotated-05740	Quirky location in the supermarket but fun to watch what's going on around.
en-unannotated-05741	We chose the BYOB option, €30 for 2 courses and there is a well stocked shop next door selling some great wine.
en-unannotated-05742	The pillows were terrible and we had to request replacements, which they did supply.
en-unannotated-05743	For dinner, I had a salad with duck gizzards, which was delicious.
en-unannotated-05744	Quite ordinary however not bad meals.
en-unannotated-05745	This hotel has it all going on.
en-unannotated-05746	Room server charge for delivery
en-unannotated-05747	The Beef Tartare portion was huge and when I asked for more garlic for my beef, the server gave me a good gravy bowl of it!
en-unannotated-05748	...apparently I got over the smell at some point to allow me to stay for the length of three blueberry beers (70 CZK/beer which is expensive for Prague)! The best beer I drank in Prague.
en-unannotated-05749	You won't find blow drier in the bathroom or a vegetarian or vegan friendly food in the restaurant.
en-unannotated-05750	Nice pizza oven in the front where we even saw a take out pizza.
en-unannotated-05751	Kids loved the little pipe cleaner puppets - kept them entertaining whilst we finished our...
en-unannotated-05752	A shining star in a sea of fantastic places to eat.
en-unannotated-05753	It had the right amount of sourness from the cabbage and the beef was tender.
en-unannotated-05754	I feel the pressure to continue the 5 star reviews.
en-unannotated-05755	Since its a turistic spot you should do Food without chile.
en-unannotated-05756	Great food, really lovely staff (they brought us a lot of samples to help us decide), and awesome ambiance
en-unannotated-05757	We have tried Russian pirozhki, borsch, some salads and everything was excellent.
en-unannotated-05758	When you first walk into the lobby and look around you are in a different world.
en-unannotated-05759	Super yummy and delicious all of them!
en-unannotated-05760	Now I know, they would have been referring to Survey Co.
en-unannotated-05761	I absolutely love this game.
en-unannotated-05762	Word to the wise do not play Jenga if you happen to be a table sharer, unless the other table sharers are inquisitive foreign tourists and desperately want to know what the Irish Banking system collapse looked like!
en-unannotated-05763	I also got the smoothie of the day, which was banana, peach, and orange juice, made only with fresh fruit that is peeled upon order.
en-unannotated-05764	Lucky enough to go on weekday when there wasn't a line.
en-unannotated-05765	All good.
en-unannotated-05766	Very clean, functional and ideally located in Madrid.
en-unannotated-05767	The rooms are quite large, equipped with everything you need.
en-unannotated-05768	It was exquisite.
en-unannotated-05769	We thought the food was very good but not quite what we expected for the price.
en-unannotated-05770	If you love adventure in the great wide somewhere or just LOVE hanging out with locals or LOVE meeting new people, this experience is for YOU!
en-unannotated-05771	Wifi signal was weak, water pressure was not strong enough to take a shower, and breakfast was disappointing.
en-unannotated-05772	It was the best meal in our 7 days visit in Barcelona.
en-unannotated-05773	She didn't say anything so I figured it was not q big deal.
en-unannotated-05774	The quality of the food is top and the price really low, the beer is at the level of the reputation.
en-unannotated-05775	The food was very...
en-unannotated-05776	The food was nice, but not the best sushi to date and 2 of my choices were no longer available.
en-unannotated-05777	Need to make reservation since the place is small
en-unannotated-05778	Inside of hotel is well decorated but very dark and gloomy.
en-unannotated-05779	The only thing to do is grind for more toads, which is incredibly repetitive.
en-unannotated-05780	So we came to this hotel in San Sebastian.
en-unannotated-05781	All the room types are nearly same, very old type of bed, chair, bathroom, wardrobe.
en-unannotated-05782	The server was very attentive!
en-unannotated-05783	There was good storage and the room was nicely presented.
en-unannotated-05784	The pork knuckle.
en-unannotated-05785	For dessert dark chocolate...
en-unannotated-05786	What a wonderful dining experience.
en-unannotated-05787	Location
en-unannotated-05788	The breakfast...
en-unannotated-05789	Phenomenal.
en-unannotated-05790	For around 2 bucks, its hands down, the best add-on on the menu, and adorns everything beautifully.
en-unannotated-05791	We went to the bar, and, although very busy, I got served immediately.
en-unannotated-05792	The Gaelic boxty was delicious.
en-unannotated-05793	Staff was verry friendly and helpful.
en-unannotated-05794	My first time in Dublin and I love the private room situation and the candles!!!!
en-unannotated-05795	Yes, I am a devourer, Just not adventurous.
en-unannotated-05796	I wouldn't rave about this place about the food but it's worth every penny too.
en-unannotated-05797	The meat is tender and the seasoning perfected.
en-unannotated-05798	Tricky to find but you're nearly there if you find the megafauna fibreglass koala.
en-unannotated-05799	Beautiful, elegant, precious hotel!
en-unannotated-05800	however I m rating it as 3 star since this game do not offer fairplay to that extend.
en-unannotated-05801	What I liked the most is that on reception I was given a smartphone that I could take with me everywhere and use it as a hotspot for unlimited internet and also it had a software with descriptions and directions for different sightseeings and restaurants, it was super convenient and thoughtful.
en-unannotated-05802	Right from when I arrived, the staff were very attentive and friendly, and I was swiftly brought an amuse bouche.
en-unannotated-05803	Freshly made pasta with rich filling and sauce, the flavors were prefect.
en-unannotated-05804	This is a must if you want to have an authentic old fashion but very tasty breakfast.
en-unannotated-05805	Alongside both entrees was rocket salad and potatoes.
en-unannotated-05806	Wonderful food.
en-unannotated-05807	We highly recommend the experience!
en-unannotated-05808	Had a good time
en-unannotated-05809	Try the banana loaf.
en-unannotated-05810	Especially when the same one comes up every 2 or 3! I know they make their money by it but lessen the amount please!
en-unannotated-05811	MISTAKE.
en-unannotated-05812	The room was very clean.
en-unannotated-05813	Everything I tried was amazing and the meat sauce with the ravioli was so flavorful and delicious.
en-unannotated-05814	The hotel is new, has a cool modern design, very helpful staff and good location
en-unannotated-05815	They were super sweet and helpful....
en-unannotated-05816	The dining area has room for a half a dozen tables but they...
en-unannotated-05817	I now consider this THE BEST RESTAURANT in the world.
en-unannotated-05818	Beautiful oysters as well.
en-unannotated-05819	OR, attempt to find it off Elizabeth street.
en-unannotated-05820	Wine was brilliant too.
en-unannotated-05821	We could not get a reservation for Friday night but hopped in at about 9:00 pm and only waited for 15 minutes or do to get seated.
en-unannotated-05822	They are very helpful when it comes to ordering sake.
en-unannotated-05823	Pushkin would like it.
en-unannotated-05824	Foie gras - amazing
en-unannotated-05825	We chose this hotel because close by to the fields, restaurants and shopping.
en-unannotated-05826	I have been to every "best fish tacos" places and this by far is the BEST I EVER HAD.
en-unannotated-05827	This hotel is close to everything if you can walk a mile or so.
en-unannotated-05828	Fantastic food in the menu for breakfast (conchas con nata to begin with), get there early and will enjoy the service and the quality of the dishes; then the location is superb for a sightseeing walking tour in Alameda, Bellas Artes and ending at the...
en-unannotated-05829	The menu is a range of the usual pan-Italian inspired breads, pizzas, pastas, risottos and salads with a few creative twists.
en-unannotated-05830	I would definitely go back here again but if they continued with this super slow service it would definitely be a bit of a turn off...
en-unannotated-05831	TV channels were not kid friendly or available in English.
en-unannotated-05832	This small restaurant on a very small street is a must for foodies.
en-unannotated-05833	The bathrooms while they were clean, the floor tiles were stained.
en-unannotated-05834	Agua y Sal...
en-unannotated-05835	Decent selection of craft beers on tap & bottles.
en-unannotated-05836	Great atmosphere and the staff are brilliant.
en-unannotated-05837	This place was my first restaurant I had at Prague.
en-unannotated-05838	We each chose differently and then shared.....
en-unannotated-05839	Worst app ever, since Hailo has gone you cannot get a taxi with this app, it's the greatest load of shite ever!!!!!!!
en-unannotated-05840	Not improving Tinder
en-unannotated-05841	Hotel staff is nice and friendly but hardly anyone speaks English.
en-unannotated-05842	Friendly, helpful staff..
en-unannotated-05843	I ordered a side of fries to offset my healthy salad and the whole table fought over them.
en-unannotated-05844	This is my new favourite coffee shop.
en-unannotated-05845	I can't wait to go back!
en-unannotated-05846	Soooo, we decided we'd concentrate on the ceviches and oh,...
en-unannotated-05847	Pri e is reasonable!
en-unannotated-05848	Although I didn't get to try their food menu, everything on it looked really good, especially for those who have already maxed out on their 'traditional Irish food' quota.
en-unannotated-05849	In addition, we could not put our clothes in wardrobe, because of the insects inside.
en-unannotated-05850	Lots of cheese, herbs and potatoes, so appropriate for a cold winter night.
en-unannotated-05851	The gratins!!!
en-unannotated-05852	I was attracted and decided to go the restaurant by all it's overwhelmingly favorable reviews.
en-unannotated-05853	I thought my meal was fantastic, each bite was amazing I didn't want it to end.
en-unannotated-05854	Had read what a great coffee place this is and a cool little bar.
en-unannotated-05855	Perfect end to our meal!
en-unannotated-05856	Annoying.
en-unannotated-05857	We all ordered something different and we all liked our meals.
en-unannotated-05858	Right away we were greeted with the sweet server I've seen in multiple photos of this restaurant, and he was just as personable and friendly as people described him.
en-unannotated-05859	My group were equally happy with the food, portion and very happy with the booth we got.
en-unannotated-05860	) What a great concept.
en-unannotated-05861	Our first room had ants everywhere.
en-unannotated-05862	The whole bathroom was flooded after I showered and there were bugs.
en-unannotated-05863	I decided to still give this place a chance, and ordered a pilsner at the bar while waiting.
en-unannotated-05864	He took the time to explain and translate his menu so that we could order the perfect dish.
en-unannotated-05865	I highly recommend this restaurant to everybody.
en-unannotated-05866	- Damaged carpet;
en-unannotated-05867	Tasty place to stop for lunch as you brew the Guinness storehouse.
en-unannotated-05868	If you are craving JMH/Bunker coffee on the weekend, you can even visit their tent at The Milton Markets on Sundays (another must-do in Brisbane).
en-unannotated-05869	On this visit I went straight for a main dish of the Achiote braised pork shoulder with Dutch cream potatoes, agave, ricotta salata and chicharrón.
en-unannotated-05870	It's not cheap but reasonably priced.
en-unannotated-05871	Incredible food, beautiful views, staff were very attentive and friendly.
en-unannotated-05872	Has chef's specials which were wonderful.
en-unannotated-05873	Meat was grainy...
en-unannotated-05874	If you craving pizza this is the place to go!
en-unannotated-05875	The Diavalo was not really spicy but was fantastic.
en-unannotated-05876	Well that is just because you need to play it more to get better at it.
en-unannotated-05877	It's as good as all the reviews say it is.
en-unannotated-05878	Owner is friendly even though cannot speak english.
en-unannotated-05879	The common parts!!
en-unannotated-05880	Lovely little place looking over the Seine.
en-unannotated-05881	This is a very old building and the walls are extremely thin.
en-unannotated-05882	The lighting in the room is too dark.
en-unannotated-05883	I definitely recommend this as a must for your visit to Prague.
en-unannotated-05884	Extensive wine list for its size.
en-unannotated-05885	The best part - you could ask for the drink to be smoked.
en-unannotated-05886	We arrived after lunch time so there were very few customers in the restaurant (We heard this place often gets busy). We had to flag down the lady in the restaurant to order.
en-unannotated-05887	The atmosphere was sleepy.
en-unannotated-05888	[4/5] Particularly enjoyed the salami and pate.
en-unannotated-05889	The images shown online vs the actual rooms are quite different.
en-unannotated-05890	You go through the process of making an account just to listen to 30 second previews.
en-unannotated-05891	Specially the attention and service of Ivan Padilla with a smile and great attitude has made me come back several times!
en-unannotated-05892	The "5 star " hotel couldn't arrange it so we booked one via uber ..
en-unannotated-05893	It was light and so tasty.
en-unannotated-05894	They made some great nachos, advised us on some delicious rums, really recommend.
en-unannotated-05895	Great for breakfast and lunch.
en-unannotated-05896	Yes!
en-unannotated-05897	com" receipt.
en-unannotated-05898	Craving one right now.
en-unannotated-05899	In a word...
en-unannotated-05900	I liked my penne, especially the big chunks of salmon.
en-unannotated-05901	We enjoyed staying at this hotel- the room was spacious and clean.
en-unannotated-05902	Breakfast is very tasty, the room at any time finishing clean
en-unannotated-05903	Instantly welcomed and Sat down to a beautiful sophisticated yet very cool setting.
en-unannotated-05904	It's a hidden gem down a side street...
en-unannotated-05905	Both were tasty and inexpensive.
en-unannotated-05906	I only have one complain.
en-unannotated-05907	It is also very close to the louvre museum.
en-unannotated-05908	This Marriott is beautiful, nicely decorated and with a great gym and pool.
en-unannotated-05909	The food was average, not outstanding but the service made up for that.
en-unannotated-05910	Or two!!
en-unannotated-05911	Surprisingly, these were incredibly tender.
en-unannotated-05912	* Don't feel silly if you can't manage the bathroom taps straight away.
en-unannotated-05913	when I download this game I was happy but I am now serious about the new characters have this much few time.
en-unannotated-05914	Yes, it's at the far side of Playa Concha, and "up the hill".
en-unannotated-05915	Had to have cheese to finish, just to keep trying out the wine list.
en-unannotated-05916	You really could not ask for more.
en-unannotated-05917	Food is high quality for a very reasonable price.
en-unannotated-05918	Very simply prepared and excellent!
en-unannotated-05919	What a lovely old hotel We have been here before but not for many years.
en-unannotated-05920	A must go place for visitors.
en-unannotated-05921	Happy I found them on a Sunday.
en-unannotated-05922	It was quite a lot for me to finish one but I ate the whole thing because I'm a huge lover of cheese.
en-unannotated-05923	Which was so tiny my cramps got cramps.
en-unannotated-05924	But it keeps freezing then coming back on and I've crashed.
en-unannotated-05925	At the end of the street hides this little gem.
en-unannotated-05926	It's decorated somewhere between old man pub & hipster, has lots of random quirky little details.
en-unannotated-05927	This place is small and rusted but was cozy and warm.
en-unannotated-05928	Not even too expensive, if you can control yourself.
en-unannotated-05929	They make three different ones each day based on the freshest ingredients they have on hand.
en-unannotated-05930	The bread was thick and didn't like the toughness but that's probably how Irish people like their bread.
en-unannotated-05931	Not sure when we will be back to Paris but this will definitely be our spot to come back to.
en-unannotated-05932	Food: 4.5 stars
en-unannotated-05933	My husband and I spent a weekend in this boutique hotel and loved our stay.
en-unannotated-05934	Front desk staff is on point.
en-unannotated-05935	Go and enjoy!
en-unannotated-05936	We started with a bunch of "pickled things" -- now if you think garlic is a date deal-breaker, you're in for a loss.
en-unannotated-05937	I'd say to pass on the curds.
en-unannotated-05938	Great food and coffees.
en-unannotated-05939	They were so right!
en-unannotated-05940	The mechanics in the room are a bit noisy.
en-unannotated-05941	The language for me is an issue as I don't speak Espanol.
en-unannotated-05942	This place was everything we hoped for and more.
en-unannotated-05943	Very friendly staff.
en-unannotated-05944	The waiter was extremely kind and helpful in translating the menu from French to English.
en-unannotated-05945	All of the staff was very nice ( which is not a given in Corsica), and always made sure we had what we needed.
en-unannotated-05946	There is a stand outside in the alcove if there is no room inside.
en-unannotated-05947	Call this winning
en-unannotated-05948	If you're squirmish and don't want to eat small fish with their head on this is not the dish for you lol.
en-unannotated-05949	1. It is almost always full and you often have to wait to order, not to mention to get a table or a seat (I admit that its me being grumpy and impatient, blaming them for their own success)
en-unannotated-05950	Nice deck with ocean view.
en-unannotated-05951	The food is way better than you would expect at a beer hall.
en-unannotated-05952	Awful Awful Awful!
en-unannotated-05953	Our west facing room was extremely hot.
en-unannotated-05954	Rooms are as advertised , clean and fresh.
en-unannotated-05955	This is a short safe walk.
en-unannotated-05956	I was in this hotel during the month of February, very bad food and service is not the best, I poison with food from the hotel, ask a physician to the room and never had to spend the whole day in bed and vomiting.
en-unannotated-05957	The ambience of this cafe is very modern and relaxing .
en-unannotated-05958	Comfortable room.
en-unannotated-05959	I managed to stray from my usual order of Cajun Prawn Fettuccine and opted to try the Scallop Linguine on my last visit and was not disappointed - it too was truly delicious.
en-unannotated-05960	No, it never came.
en-unannotated-05961	The photos are much better than the actual rooms.
en-unannotated-05962	I might try again on another night if we stay a while longer!
en-unannotated-05963	The drinks list is extensive with several cocktails around the $16 mark, a large range of beers and spirits and a long wine list with some decent ones by the glass.
en-unannotated-05964	We came after a hike from the pyramids.
en-unannotated-05965	Modern, open design around a large covered courtyard.
en-unannotated-05966	So glad we ordered it because we were scraping the bottom of the bowl to get the last bits of it.
en-unannotated-05967	I did enjoy the little punch card our waitress put on the table after I ordered my beer (which was only 37 Kc or less than $2).
en-unannotated-05968	And I can see the passion that the dude who plates them at the 'going out" station has in the food.
en-unannotated-05969	The food was classic and yummy.
en-unannotated-05970	Stopped here for lunch twice while in Prague.
en-unannotated-05971	Fresh and tasty.
en-unannotated-05972	She enjoys EDM so if you like that kind of music, you're in for a good treat as the night goes on.
en-unannotated-05973	I ordered the beef goulash with a mix of potato dumplings and bread dumplings, and my bf ordered the steak tartare with fried bread.
en-unannotated-05974	Yes.
en-unannotated-05975	On Foursquare it's rare 6.7 out of 10 which isn't a good sign.
en-unannotated-05976	I am not a POZOLE fan, but this POZOLE is very very good, you can try also quesadillas, flautas, cochinita, and napolitano flan, all food here is very good, and...
en-unannotated-05977	It was spread out over different buildings and linked by pleasant courtyards.
en-unannotated-05978	See my review for Sedm konšelů...
en-unannotated-05979	Pizza frutti di mare was a very good decision.
en-unannotated-05980	The problem...
en-unannotated-05981	Bit pricy but just beautiful.
en-unannotated-05982	It's popularity hasn't waned since opening and I hear that it can still be difficult to get a reservation.
en-unannotated-05983	Especially the Philly.
en-unannotated-05984	The room was soooo small for a family of 4. For what we paid for it was not great.
en-unannotated-05985	The cakes where not properly covered in buttercream or cheese cheese...
en-unannotated-05986	The food was great and the hosts were wonderful.
en-unannotated-05987	Great location!
en-unannotated-05988	It's a "quality over quantity" kind of place but easy to justify the bill in the end when everything was absolutely delicious.
en-unannotated-05989	Quick and friendly, the food is AMAZING, and the place is clean and has a homey atmosphere.
en-unannotated-05990	U have to pay real money for the rest of the levels.
en-unannotated-05991	I always love supporting local businesses, so I found Brew through Yelp and was able to walk there from our hotel.
en-unannotated-05992	Most of a us had fish.
en-unannotated-05993	I went with my family and we all enjoyed the food and atmosphere.
en-unannotated-05994	It was seriously good and not too expensive.
en-unannotated-05995	There is no room service late at night.
en-unannotated-05996	He was attentive yet allowed us to enjoy our meals.
en-unannotated-05997	The place is run by awesome guys who are always friendly and most than willing to chat cider with anyone who is so inclined - tried one of the BEST EVER cider's I have ever tasted at their behest - Black Dragon from Wales, you must try it people seriously.
en-unannotated-05998	It was definitely an interesting mix of flavors and quite tasty!
en-unannotated-05999	They led us straight to our table and explained the menu and the daily specials.
en-unannotated-06000	French fries are pretty good too.
en-unannotated-06001	The service at the bar can be quite horrendous (packed) but once that is complete the staff coming to our table were fantastic, with one gentlemen being a stand out for his manner.
en-unannotated-06002	The recommended dishes here are the gratins and I obliged the waiter's recommendation and ordered the nicoise gratin and a carafe of wine.
en-unannotated-06003	Can't wait to try another one of their gastronomic activities !
en-unannotated-06004	Service was welcoming, cheerful and efficient.
en-unannotated-06005	You really can't go wrong with the food here.
en-unannotated-06006	Located in an upscale, high rise neighborhood.
en-unannotated-06007	Worth to wait more than 30minutes!
en-unannotated-06008	Definitely too full to try dessert but will be back.
en-unannotated-06009	Came here for early dinner.
en-unannotated-06010	She was kind and generous but informative.
en-unannotated-06011	No matter how hard I tried I couldn't finish it all.
en-unannotated-06012	Omelette with Mole also comes with a tamale.
en-unannotated-06013	We wandered in one night and they found us a table even though we were busy.
en-unannotated-06014	Chose a room with a private toilet,. Got one.
en-unannotated-06015	The husband and I reviewed the food menu and stated that we should check it out.
en-unannotated-06016	For our entire stay, the hotel staff was exemplary in handling all of our needs.
en-unannotated-06017	Fantastic if you want to watch adverts and nothing more.
en-unannotated-06018	I don't speak italian so they provided me with an English menu.
en-unannotated-06019	The food was also super tasty, english menu and comes very quickly.
en-unannotated-06020	The menu has plenty of traditional Irish fare, but I knew that a boxty was the only way to go.
en-unannotated-06021	Will definitely be on my list of places to return when in Paris.
en-unannotated-06022	Our excitement abated somewhat when we...
en-unannotated-06023	Not exactly what a group of men needed after flying in from around the country for a work conference.
en-unannotated-06024	And the apple crumble for dessert...
en-unannotated-06025	We are so glad that the concierge recommended this spot.
en-unannotated-06026	We chose the 'defined' tasting menu rather than the 'chefs surprise'. All the courses were delightful, with complementary flavours and differing textures.
en-unannotated-06027	It's so interesting to hear about the parts of each dish that represent...
en-unannotated-06028	DO NOT pass on this place.
en-unannotated-06029	Small restaurant with local food.
en-unannotated-06030	From then on we heard plates banging loudly as tables were being cleared in frustration and the service became somewhat rude.
en-unannotated-06031	Food lovers who aren't necessarily looking to go full-French are well catered for here and our lamb and fries was absolutely delicious and perfectly made.
en-unannotated-06032	I went with the Miel Burger and the bf had the New York style burger.
en-unannotated-06033	(Just covering the basics...)
en-unannotated-06034	We were lucky that night.
en-unannotated-06035	They made me feel as home.
en-unannotated-06036	This restaurant is a must in San Sebastian.
en-unannotated-06037	Service was really excellent, very attentive and personable.
en-unannotated-06038	Just a thought.
en-unannotated-06039	I usually try everything local when I travel , so the menu had 'Atole'. I believe...
en-unannotated-06040	This was purely a Yelp find, and with over 100+ reviews and a perfect 5 star rating, I figured it would be worth a shot for breakfast on our last full day in Prague.
en-unannotated-06041	It's amazing!
en-unannotated-06042	Very small restaurant.
en-unannotated-06043	It's probably the best ice cream I have ever had.
en-unannotated-06044	This is not a hostal but hotel.
en-unannotated-06045	I'll be back soon Nase Maso...
en-unannotated-06046	Big/clean rooms with comfortable beds albeit a touch short in length.
en-unannotated-06047	While this one is tucked away you shouldn't miss the chance to dine here.
en-unannotated-06048	Really loved the sirloin steak with Foie gras, it's delicious, very tender!
en-unannotated-06049	Cheers [NAME]
en-unannotated-06050	The food is unbelievable and the service is even better!
en-unannotated-06051	Since the switch in using it less and less because of that, only useful for booking in advance.
en-unannotated-06052	We thought it added to its romantic charm but others may struggle.
en-unannotated-06053	Avoid the many tourist traps, enjoy pintxos like the locals do.
en-unannotated-06054	Staff very attentive and helpful.
en-unannotated-06055	No more than 7 tables in total, but my son and I had an amazing meal.
en-unannotated-06056	- Some sort of stew dish.
en-unannotated-06057	Great service and, again - best goulash in Prague!
en-unannotated-06058	The restaurant was really intimate and Jeremy made us feel instantly welcome.
en-unannotated-06059	Alternatively, they have an early bird menu with 2 courses for 23Euro as well as a set 3 course menu for 35Euro.
en-unannotated-06060	Great food and top service.
en-unannotated-06061	We had the fish of the day (barramundi) with a side of winter greens with garlic cream sauce, and the pork special of the evening.
en-unannotated-06062	Lastly, the service here is great.
en-unannotated-06063	Cute and comfortable decor and great jazz playing in the background.
en-unannotated-06064	Enjoyed a bowl of purple carrot and courriander soup and brown bread which was delicious.
en-unannotated-06065	If you're like me and needs English translation, make sure you read the English menu outside the shop before going in since the menu inside is in Czech.
en-unannotated-06066	No sound proof in the rooms & windows
en-unannotated-06067	If we had more time we would return.
en-unannotated-06068	Kind of pricey, but a great way to try new and old irish food!
en-unannotated-06069	Oh, Verve.
en-unannotated-06070	It was lovely.
en-unannotated-06071	Also on an s8. Oh well, it's a sign from god that no one needs this app.
en-unannotated-06072	Service was top notch, the greeting as my driver dropped me off was a perfect closure to my weary flight and ride in, and from then on it was all relaxation.
en-unannotated-06073	Service and decor both outstanding!
en-unannotated-06074	Reservation can be made online!
en-unannotated-06075	Can imagine what it willl look like with snow!
en-unannotated-06076	We booked a two day stay, after driving from Madrid.
en-unannotated-06077	Although I will say that our waitress was wonderful, the food was not.
en-unannotated-06078	And it was a bit messy.
en-unannotated-06079	For graphics i gave 4 stars because its simple in graphics.
en-unannotated-06080	there are much better ways to handle the situation.
en-unannotated-06081	Very average if not poor, we were expecting or rather hoping that we would have descent french meal and we all got very disappointed.
en-unannotated-06082	Sometimes I give a restaurant five stars in my mind before I even sit down, and get disappointing when it lets me down.
en-unannotated-06083	I'd highly recommend this stop for anyone visiting Dublin.
en-unannotated-06084	but it was worse.
en-unannotated-06085	😋
en-unannotated-06086	Everything has been amazing.
en-unannotated-06087	Because after I ate my dinner very quickly, my waiter thanked me.
en-unannotated-06088	The service was excellent and we stayed for the torta, a wonderful pineapple upside-down cake!
en-unannotated-06089	The owner came to each table to be sure all was good and everyone seems to really care about their patrons.
en-unannotated-06090	A literal pile of shite
en-unannotated-06091	To balance I had steamed mixed vegetables which actually were delicious in fresh butter.
en-unannotated-06092	My mom and I dined here twice during our weeklong stay in Paris and it was absolutely fantastic each time - the food, the service, the cozy ambiance.
en-unannotated-06093	Because it was my only Czech-food restaurant experience, I give it a go.
en-unannotated-06094	Also a good location next to a lot of food places and shopping that are within walking distance
en-unannotated-06095	And yet, you want to be comfortable when you are in your room.
en-unannotated-06096	What I do know is that the food is very yummy; maybe not #1 delicious but still worth a visit.
en-unannotated-06097	This place is definitely worth a visit when you're in Praha.
en-unannotated-06098	The selection of taste is very...
en-unannotated-06099	2. All the best bits of a large 4 or 5 star hotel but with a boutique feel about it.
en-unannotated-06100	No house keeping staff after 12
en-unannotated-06101	Ambiance is that of a family restaurant, nothing fancy, just purely delicious.
en-unannotated-06102	I got the bacon/avocado pancakes with a side of eggs.
en-unannotated-06103	This was the last city I decided to visit from a 3 week trip I had taken to Europe from a cousin of mine, we stayed here for one night only.
en-unannotated-06104	
en-unannotated-06105	We chose Only You Atocha as it's within walking distance to the Atocha station and it has great reviews.
en-unannotated-06106	Addition: your "bug fix" on March 27th didn't fix the issue of this game crashing at the load screen.
en-unannotated-06107	Service was excellent as well.
en-unannotated-06108	The first is a very nice and the rest, I have a lot m, and a few of my favorite, I was wondering how to make a difference in 8th grade, but it was a good day, I was just the way, the more I will have a lot.
en-unannotated-06109	The food in the bilingual menu was varied but very simple and reminded me of cafeteria food.
en-unannotated-06110	I got thr snails, peppersteak, cod fish woth squid ink spaghetti french onion soup and apple desert!
en-unannotated-06111	Side note: Average age of the patrons while we were of the age to be enjoying a Viking River Cruise.
en-unannotated-06112	Very clean and comfortable rooms.
en-unannotated-06113	My mother very happy.
en-unannotated-06114	The game that I really like just stopped and crashed.
en-unannotated-06115	This restaurant took us in without a reservation.
en-unannotated-06116	We felt like royalty.
en-unannotated-06117	His only complaint was that it was moist but not that tender.
en-unannotated-06118	Although the restaurant was full, the ambiance felt relaxed and chill.
en-unannotated-06119	Nice quint room, very clean, friendly staff.
en-unannotated-06120	It also went well with the prosecco I ordered.
en-unannotated-06121	This time I didn't stay at the hotel but went there for lunch.
en-unannotated-06122	After we...
en-unannotated-06123	Suki is fresh, super fresh.
en-unannotated-06124	It's a good game.
en-unannotated-06125	We have been yelping.
en-unannotated-06126	I've played Mario since early 80's and demo is really fun.
en-unannotated-06127	Try step up to the one bedroom suites like 310 as they have lovely space but 215 felts spacious too.
en-unannotated-06128	I could go on.
en-unannotated-06129	The lunch menu is a steal at 14E (E/P) or 16E (E/P/D). There are only two starter options, three mains and two desserts because the selection is based on what's fresh that day at the market and the chef (a super lovely woman who apparently won Top Chef!
en-unannotated-06130	If you do need public transportation there a bus and light rail stops near by
en-unannotated-06131	Just like a warm beef stew and the dumplings were the perfect thing to sop up the sauce with.
en-unannotated-06132	The price is also very reasonable on top of everything.
en-unannotated-06133	Good service and high prices.
en-unannotated-06134	The fresh strawberry tart on the other hand was basically pie crust filled with berry yogurt and topped with strawberries.
en-unannotated-06135	Yes, it could use an update but I would definitely stay here again.
en-unannotated-06136	It was perfect for two for a main course.
en-unannotated-06137	It's absolutely amazing, top-quality, fresh meat, but perhaps not for everyone.
en-unannotated-06138	Felicidades!
en-unannotated-06139	One of the best authentic French meals I had on this trip!!
en-unannotated-06140	My friends had the burger with chips and cottage pie with a side of greens.
en-unannotated-06141	For food, we started with the Caprese which was fresh and delicious.
en-unannotated-06142	I recommend either being flexible with your time or making a reservation, but either way you must visit!
en-unannotated-06143	The food quality was superb.
en-unannotated-06144	The hotel is quaint, grand and charming in some respects.
en-unannotated-06145	Living room setting, small, healthy vegetarian food, very very local.
en-unannotated-06146	I love how satisfying this app is, it makes me feel relaxed!
en-unannotated-06147	I've been a devoted fan since the beginning when it opened and I worked nearby - I always will be.
en-unannotated-06148	It is underground in a cave.
en-unannotated-06149	but are we blind?
en-unannotated-06150	location is the best !
en-unannotated-06151	We enjoyed a memorable anniversary dinner here.
en-unannotated-06152	Highly recommended coming here!
en-unannotated-06153	They offer vegan and vegetarian options, a great beer and cider selection and their takeaway haloumi bagels are a MUST do on your way out!
en-unannotated-06154	Great information and help from staff on arrival.
en-unannotated-06155	Bath was too narrow.
en-unannotated-06156	The location puts you in the heart of the city, but puts some distance between you and the rest of the mall hustle and bustle.
en-unannotated-06157	Outstanding small hotel.
en-unannotated-06158	It was a little expensive (about 200 US dollars a night) however the breakfast was awesome and the rooms were impeccable.
en-unannotated-06159	Only one regret, we were not hungry enough to order the apple strudel!
en-unannotated-06160	He went for the link which came wrapped in a thin crisp ham and with mussels which he really enjoyed.
en-unannotated-06161	Bit disappointed as it is below expectations comparing to what I could have booked for the same price.
en-unannotated-06162	Thanks so much for a great night :)
en-unannotated-06163	Service and atmosphere were to die for.
en-unannotated-06164	Came here to try their pan seared foie gras but was disappointed because they didn't have it that night!!
en-unannotated-06165	I ordered the Irish chicken in boxty pancake and my friend ordered the roasted cauliflower with boxty dumplings.
en-unannotated-06166	The facility was great large room and excellent bathroom.
en-unannotated-06167	Creme Brûlée - YUMMMM!
en-unannotated-06168	Just before lunch, I decided to go and see the Pantheon.
en-unannotated-06169	One of the best table in Ajaccio
en-unannotated-06170	What makes that even better?
en-unannotated-06171	Really nice bathroom as well with all amenities.
en-unannotated-06172	The atmosphere of the restaurant was so pleasant it made us forget about the terrible rain storm outside.
en-unannotated-06173	There are 2 menus here so ask for the English one if you still need to brush up on the French.
en-unannotated-06174	Example, Fox News was the only U.S news channel available.
en-unannotated-06175	The duck confit was piping hot and the duck texture was similar to beef.
en-unannotated-06176	Choise of several good meats and lots of sauses.
en-unannotated-06177	I'm not sure if Irish cuisine is an acquired taste or we simply ordered the wrong things but I wasn't loving the food I ordered.
en-unannotated-06178	Outstanding seafood chowder (made with saffron and dill) and teriyaki beef salad.
en-unannotated-06179	this is the third time we have stayed here on a short break to san Sebastian.
en-unannotated-06180	San Sebastian is a pretty sea-side town and beach resort with outstanding panoramic views from the hills opposite the beach.
en-unannotated-06181	The avocado had a hint of lemon juice through it which was so lovely.
en-unannotated-06182	Nope.
en-unannotated-06183	Concierge service was excellent and they were eager to help with our travel needs.
en-unannotated-06184	Everyone friendly and helpful.
en-unannotated-06185	From the warm welcome and the casual friendly atmosphere through-out the evening, to the delicious and enchanting culinary discovery; This was a brilliant experience that I can only recommend to you all.
en-unannotated-06186	Pivovar U Tří růží authentic ancient Czech Republic pub or in Czech Pivovar is moderately priced, but not expensive $$ and a must try for authentic Czech cuisine and Breweries
en-unannotated-06187	It was our last night and we were a bit tired.
en-unannotated-06188	Can be very crowed at times and there is no garden to sit outside if the weather is good.
en-unannotated-06189	It was so professional and friendly.
en-unannotated-06190	Its unacceptable.
en-unannotated-06191	The hotel is nice and clean the staff is wonderfull and they are always pending of you.
en-unannotated-06192	**Nase Maso is a butcher shop, offering local meat delicacies giving you the option to order 50+ varieties of meat - to take home or grilled to order.
en-unannotated-06193	I would...
en-unannotated-06194	Just Awesome!
en-unannotated-06195	The place needs a good clean.
en-unannotated-06196	All food is prepared to order with fresh ingredients.
en-unannotated-06197	Would definitely recommend The Survey Co to everyone.
en-unannotated-06198	We were fortunate to get the last table when we arrived.
en-unannotated-06199	The menu has a good variety.
en-unannotated-06200	Definitely a little hole in the wall you shouldn't miss!!!
en-unannotated-06201	The service is friendly and the place quiet.
en-unannotated-06202	But it's not too big portions without delicate and well-balanced goodies.
en-unannotated-06203	Definitely must visit even only for a drink.
en-unannotated-06204	For mains I went with the cod and [NAME] selected the lamb.
en-unannotated-06205	I ordered the spaghetti carbonara which was rich and creamy.
en-unannotated-06206	However all our doubts were put to rest when we checked in.
en-unannotated-06207	I would suggest the entrees are overpriced.
en-unannotated-06208	There is also a selection of cheeses and desserts.
en-unannotated-06209	Below marginal food.
en-unannotated-06210	So disappointing.
en-unannotated-06211	Great location - on the river at the edge of the old city.
en-unannotated-06212	The little bowl of them were not enough though as I could have had them for a meal.
en-unannotated-06213	We headed to Bilbao and on to San Sebastián where the highlight was to be lunch at Akelarre .
en-unannotated-06214	Hotel is old which is nice in authentic look and feel however for 400 EURO a night I would expect rooms with proper showers, well maintained and Air condition that doesn't pop sewer smell when u turn it on- teally horrible
en-unannotated-06215	We were staying one night at this hotel for a soccer tournament.
en-unannotated-06216	Total: 26€ for my meal-- which included part a 10% service charge for groups of 6+
en-unannotated-06217	1). Great drinks.
en-unannotated-06218	We were led inside an underground grotto which had been transformed into a dark Czech eatery.
en-unannotated-06219	The location, the room, the staff - everything.
en-unannotated-06220	Nicolas' square.
en-unannotated-06221	There's maybe 3 or 4 bar style tables fitting no more than a dozen at most.
en-unannotated-06222	I'd love to play my friends but that seems impossible with this app.
en-unannotated-06223	This was another winning restaurant well worth discovering.
en-unannotated-06224	Whatever.
en-unannotated-06225	Will come back again soon.
en-unannotated-06226	Their kindness is a special characteristic from Colombians.
en-unannotated-06227	My husband was hit in the back with a flying soccer ball while trying to get coffee in the morning.
en-unannotated-06228	Bit of a disappointment.
en-unannotated-06229	The breakfast was good, and brought to the room.
en-unannotated-06230	Couldn't spend your last €20 any better.
en-unannotated-06231	The meatloaf I always had was with tomato sauce and ground beef and mehhhh.
en-unannotated-06232	My wife, who despises both snails and mushrooms, was dipping her bread in it feverishly.
en-unannotated-06233	Deserts, outstanding.
en-unannotated-06234	Most enjoyable stay.
en-unannotated-06235	If not, I'd skip it.
en-unannotated-06236	Just one word: what the fuck do they put on those potatoes??
en-unannotated-06237	Breakfast buffet was outstanding and very nicely decorated.
en-unannotated-06238	The maincourses however were a bit plain (fish with lemonspinache and the beergulasch)
en-unannotated-06239	Prices are affordable and waiters very kind.
en-unannotated-06240	Staff is wonderful too!
en-unannotated-06241	Accidentally walked into this place , had latte n tuna salad , both were very good , will try different thing the next time I'm in the area
en-unannotated-06242	While dinning I asked when we come back next year, what do you want to do again that we have done so far and coming back to this place is definitely a must.
en-unannotated-06243	My stay was generally well, with the housekeeping staff and the front desk being generally friendly.
en-unannotated-06244	I highly recommend La Valise.
en-unannotated-06245	Fantastic place right off the main square in Prague.
en-unannotated-06246	Standouts included the sweet sour pickled prawns...
en-unannotated-06247	We stayed there for 3 nights and we're very happy with everything!
en-unannotated-06248	Very good environment with nice spaces.
en-unannotated-06249	but customer service one of the worst I experienced.
en-unannotated-06250	I'm not sure what the problem is but I will delete this app and just go back to IG where I don't have any problems.
en-unannotated-06251	I would definetly recommend it not only to larger groups but also just an intimate dinner as the place has a nice vibe and...
en-unannotated-06252	You will not go wrong here!!
en-unannotated-06253	Two months later we did!
en-unannotated-06254	You'll be licking & dipping the cone in the choc powder in no time.
en-unannotated-06255	When we stepped outside of the restaurant my wife noticed a huge fish-smelling stain on my shirt and my jacket was stained as well.
en-unannotated-06256	Jean Yves managed to create such an atmosphere where everyone immediately felt an ease and very relaxed.
en-unannotated-06257	We were pretty full from just these, so we split the duck confit with red cabbage and dumplings.
en-unannotated-06258	It was again just delicious, juicy, bursting with ingredients flavors and high quality poultry.
en-unannotated-06259	But got to give credit where it's due, this one was yum!
en-unannotated-06260	Also booked for 3 single beds + got 2 +1 sofa bed instead
en-unannotated-06261	No apology was given or explanation offerred when we arrived.
en-unannotated-06262	Salads were fabulous
en-unannotated-06263	I had the pleasure of going for brunch a few weeks ago with a friend to The Little Kitchen on a raining Saturday afternoon.
en-unannotated-06264	Lots of nice touches - arty flowers in water tubes; tea, a kettle and fresh rolls and croisants outside rooms every day.
en-unannotated-06265	I've been before for romantic one-on-ones, 30+ group parties, small family dinners, rowdy drinks at the bar, today I went for a quiet lunch with an out-of-town pal, and this place can cater to all of them.
en-unannotated-06266	Then as Secondo piatto we only had the vitello tonnato with roasted potatoes.
en-unannotated-06267	Breakfast Buffet and free WiFi included.
en-unannotated-06268	Long line in the front so I walked straight to the back where the gal was making coffee.
en-unannotated-06269	This is a very good game...
en-unannotated-06270	Even if I have to first activate it in the settings or so.
en-unannotated-06271	Because I am a glutton and the portions here are on the small side, I got the banana AND the Nutella ones on my second visit.
en-unannotated-06272	Game is good but when we have good coins and then we play game and search for people to play with us then guest comes which is computer i think because if we r playing good then also he wins that was computer i know because i play this game for 2 months and when guest player come we will loss the game rather we play a good .
en-unannotated-06273	Some of the best burgers in Brisbane, but not quite top dog (that would be Chur IMHO). I do need to try more of them.
en-unannotated-06274	Charming, small family owned restaurant that immediately made me feel welcome.
en-unannotated-06275	I mean, seriously, if you are serving three types of Irish stew, boxty, champ, and colcannon, your own and others porters and ale, why would you play crappy non-Irish music?
en-unannotated-06276	Service was impeccable at Blackbird with the wait staff explaining the components of each dish as it came out and also offered well paired wine choices.
en-unannotated-06277	We had to come back one more time before we left.
en-unannotated-06278	You can...
en-unannotated-06279	I've been living in Milan for couple months now..
en-unannotated-06280	Ordered the scampi pasta and it was great.
en-unannotated-06281	I understand they've earned international accolades so maybe they just had a bad night?
en-unannotated-06282	A lot of restaurants inside and in the surrounding area.
en-unannotated-06283	If you're looking for good food and an unforgettable atmosphere, this is the place to go.
en-unannotated-06284	Not only that, but our food was impeccable.
en-unannotated-06285	Still can't manage to hail or see any taxi's so it's useless.
en-unannotated-06286	Our first night in Spain was a truly unique experience with a combination of great food, amazing company and a lot of fun.
en-unannotated-06287	These were actually pretty nice: it only was a shame that we only ate half of it when the maincourses arrived.
en-unannotated-06288	Location is good.
en-unannotated-06289	It's missing a "wow" factor to carry it off successfully!
en-unannotated-06290	Kudos to Marcos and Ruben.
en-unannotated-06291	Really enjoyed my trip here.
en-unannotated-06292	It has the quaintness that a lot of NYC restaurants strive for and the risotto is unbeatable.
en-unannotated-06293	It was a pumpkin based soup and was very hearty and flavorful.
en-unannotated-06294	Not many tables, but it's worth the wait.
en-unannotated-06295	My room was very nice.
en-unannotated-06296	
en-unannotated-06297	He did not even bother to turn it off even though a customer was seating in front of him.
en-unannotated-06298	Loved that it was a green hotel.
en-unannotated-06299	It is.
en-unannotated-06300	Delicate food presented in a super professional fashion.
en-unannotated-06301	The room was not ready on our arrival and was 3 hours later than we requested.
en-unannotated-06302	Unfortunately when we arrived we were not welcomed very well...
en-unannotated-06303	Rooms small but well equipped, good size TV, excellent hairdryer, aircon etc.
en-unannotated-06304	Simply amazing!
en-unannotated-06305	We had a weekday lunch for 3 and every meal was perfect.
en-unannotated-06306	It doesn't seem to be over - crowded here and that's probably because it's a little further off from the main routes.
en-unannotated-06307	You've found it here!
en-unannotated-06308	A perfect place to rest and work in Bogota.
en-unannotated-06309	it us perfectly located and the staff is warm welcoming and super helpful
en-unannotated-06310	LOVED the Hotel Villa Magna!
en-unannotated-06311	Not a 5 stars treatment
en-unannotated-06312	The staff are friendly and very professional.
en-unannotated-06313	The jars of macerated rum look great.
en-unannotated-06314	I also splurged on dessert and went with the recommended crepe Nutella over my favorite soufflé dessert and was very pleased with the crepe, even if I was overly stuffed by the time I walked out the door.
en-unannotated-06315	On a Sunday afternoon, my friends and I stayed in line for more than 30 mins before getting a table.
en-unannotated-06316	The location is excellent and reasonably quiet.
en-unannotated-06317	Always an amazing experience.
en-unannotated-06318	where people line up to get a reservation?
en-unannotated-06319	I was also happy to discover that the price of pints is incredibly reasonable for a restaurant that looks so high end.
en-unannotated-06320	They are so good that they pack them in for lunch and then close for dinner!
en-unannotated-06321	The young lady...
en-unannotated-06322	Shortly after we were seated, there were immediate signs of life as people starting making their way in.
en-unannotated-06323	Not to be expected.
en-unannotated-06324	Available in different combinations, we chose the bacon and cheese as well as duck and goat cheese option.
en-unannotated-06325	Also, the menu lists sweet potato wedges, but they didn't actually have those, although they did have sweet potato fries.
en-unannotated-06326	It was definitely one of the best things we ate in Paris!
en-unannotated-06327	Wow a taste sensation!
en-unannotated-06328	A lot of restaurants around and 4 different malls.
en-unannotated-06329	It's cafeteria style seating in tight quarters but it's worth it.
en-unannotated-06330	We enjoyed so much our dinner that we actually...
en-unannotated-06331	The view of the sea is stunning, and the food is amazing.
en-unannotated-06332	We chose this place because it was reasonably close to Bogatell metro and had been highlighted on tripadvisor.
en-unannotated-06333	The staff is very kind and helpful.
en-unannotated-06334	The wine selection also very nice!
en-unannotated-06335	Must go to for chocolate lovers .
en-unannotated-06336	spacious rooms
en-unannotated-06337	There are temporary desks for check-in.
en-unannotated-06338	Removing features with no benefit.
en-unannotated-06339	First, the location is stupendous -- a couple of blocks from Zocalo and near lots of restaurants.
en-unannotated-06340	Great place going back for dinner.
en-unannotated-06341	great trip, helpful staff !!!
en-unannotated-06342	Took one star because we did not make a reservation and walked in and was unable to order many of the food items because it took too long to make.
en-unannotated-06343	If I could give it zero I would absolutely scutter doesn't work
en-unannotated-06344	The lines get long, but most people get takeaway and the staff are so efficient that the lines moves quickly.
en-unannotated-06345	Also, there is no cocktail menu and the only liquor they carry is gin.
en-unannotated-06346	Da Oscar exceeded my expectations!
en-unannotated-06347	However, this time the experience was a true nightmare.
en-unannotated-06348	Only good thing is the location.
en-unannotated-06349	The common theme at Nase Maso is that they focus on bringing out the natural flavour of their meats.
en-unannotated-06350	The peas are infused with bacon which makes them especially tasty.
en-unannotated-06351	I don't normally write reviews, but I was so impressed by my experience this afternoon that I owed it to them to leave one.
en-unannotated-06352	Ingredients are simple but was magic in my mouth.
en-unannotated-06353	I expected more.
en-unannotated-06354	I've spent at least three time there.
en-unannotated-06355	Cute hipster fit-out (without being too pretentious or ironic) and juuust enough room to squeeze in the hoards of people looking for a caffeine fix.
en-unannotated-06356	The food is good with a good selection of food.
en-unannotated-06357	You only have few experiences like this in your lifetime!!
en-unannotated-06358	We had seafood stew and president salad as starters.
en-unannotated-06359	We shared the bailey cheesecake for dessert and could barely finish it.
en-unannotated-06360	Homely, comfortable, and welcoming.
en-unannotated-06361	I had the fish pie and it was very, very good.
en-unannotated-06362	We loved it
en-unannotated-06363	The staff is great especially the front desk manager Diana.
en-unannotated-06364	Very cool.
en-unannotated-06365	Nice coffee shop in Arbat street.
en-unannotated-06366	The location was excellent,very close to everything.
en-unannotated-06367	And don't even get me started on the gravy...
en-unannotated-06368	Staff are lovely.
en-unannotated-06369	If you want a stunning night out with a breathtaking view of Brisbane City, go.
en-unannotated-06370	The Wagyu burger is also delicious, which I would go for if they were out of the dry-aged, and the Svickova, which was an okay steak.
en-unannotated-06371	Highly recommend, especially because it is affordable!
en-unannotated-06372	They were my favorite part of our meal.
en-unannotated-06373	Likes don't go through and people you like/dislike show up time and time again.
en-unannotated-06374	Should have more choice of food and a more elaborate BF menu there should be no extra charge for eggs ordered
en-unannotated-06375	We had eaten here several times before and looked forward to another meal.
en-unannotated-06376	We stayed in this hotel for over 2 weeks while visiting my pregnant wifes family in Bogota.
en-unannotated-06377	My least favorite, found it a little sweet.
en-unannotated-06378	Highly recommend this hotel for your stay.
en-unannotated-06379	But the consistent excellent service compelled me to review again.
en-unannotated-06380	We ordered, and sat on the third floor enjoying the fabulous beer...
en-unannotated-06381	- Uncomfortable mattress & bedding;
en-unannotated-06382	Grand app cant log in tho.?
en-unannotated-06383	Not sure when it flew in, but unpleasant sight on top of our cabbage soup.
en-unannotated-06384	The pasta itself is super homemade with plenty of flavor and then the sauces are a gift from heaven.
en-unannotated-06385	Food is delicious, and portions are big and prices are very affordable.
en-unannotated-06386	Not sure.
en-unannotated-06387	I've only been back in the states for a couple months and I already miss Ireland's soda bread!
en-unannotated-06388	Sedap, oishi, delicious!
en-unannotated-06389	you may need Google Maps to find it!
en-unannotated-06390	Something went wrong please try again later.
en-unannotated-06391	The overall experience was excellent.
en-unannotated-06392	Very impressed.
en-unannotated-06393	It looks to be working fine now, will increase the number of stars if it keeps working.
en-unannotated-06394	The only issue I would say was the sound of water flowing down the pipes..
en-unannotated-06395	My wife and I both thoroughly enjoyed our evening at Lanziego.
en-unannotated-06396	Take the stairs or elevator to the first floor.
en-unannotated-06397	I'm more of a dry gal but there are sweet versions that will make your heart palpitate.
en-unannotated-06398	), house white wine, and pistachio cake, €29.00. I left pretty stuffed and happy.
en-unannotated-06399	The Trio of Lamb for two was terrific.
en-unannotated-06400	Served in a mason jar with a striped straw so also super cute!
en-unannotated-06401	For entrees, we went with the duck and the scallops.
en-unannotated-06402	I found...
en-unannotated-06403	Thanks!
en-unannotated-06404	Plz bring back TIX evern if i gives us one rubux a week so the people who wants rubux fast will just buy so you will not lose that much money.
en-unannotated-06405	They also sell keep-cups if you'd like to be a little more sustainable with your coffee run.
en-unannotated-06406	Noblesse will make your stay in Milan memorable!
en-unannotated-06407	The dish seemed like it straight up came from the sea with the long tentacle of the octopus.
en-unannotated-06408	i feel i'm just at home.
en-unannotated-06409	If I had 18 thumbs they would all be up....
en-unannotated-06410	Get it.
en-unannotated-06411	I don't give five stars lightly, but my dining experience was only pleasant; I have no complaints!
en-unannotated-06412	All together we paid 48 Euro which was incredibly good !
en-unannotated-06413	If you love your foie gras five ways, eight ways, twelve ways, this is the place for you.
en-unannotated-06414	Yikes.
en-unannotated-06415	Especial the side dishes were great.
en-unannotated-06416	At the end the same guy who insulted me by telling me I was ordering too much, gave me the check and told me that the tip was it included.
en-unannotated-06417	I've been to The Little Kitchen a number of times for both brunch and dinner and each time it is just superb.
en-unannotated-06418	The next dish is a cuttlefish and artichoke risotto.
en-unannotated-06419	We came here pretty late on a Saturday night (9 pmish) and where lucky enough to get a table without a reservation.
en-unannotated-06420	You can hire stretchers and a parasol.
en-unannotated-06421	The house pink lemonade, as well as the lime & ginger were beautifully blended non -alcoholic drinks, and the Ma Cherie cocktail that I had was lovely too.
en-unannotated-06422	Plenty of pepper, fresh sharp cheese, perfectly cooked pasta, and not too wet or too dry.
en-unannotated-06423	- to your neighbors, this is not the place for you to go). The menu has about 5 Starters and 6-7 main dishes and still one sounds better than the other.
en-unannotated-06424	we were celebrating our anniversary and requested a special table but feeling that they gave us any table..
en-unannotated-06425	Service was efficient, yet friendly and unrushed.
en-unannotated-06426	We had a great time.
en-unannotated-06427	Stopped by here on a Tuesday night and was able to get a table for 2 at 7 without a reservation.
en-unannotated-06428	Hidden in plain sight, Brew is so incredibly hipster.
en-unannotated-06429	First time using this app.
en-unannotated-06430	We visited Epicure in May, 2017, having visited the restaurant 3 years previously when we had a stellar lunch.
en-unannotated-06431	It was so light and fresh and really delicious.
en-unannotated-06432	The beer was so-so.
en-unannotated-06433	Had...
en-unannotated-06434	highly recommend!
en-unannotated-06435	I ordered the duck with bananas and my husband ordered steak.
en-unannotated-06436	Authentic, fresh italian cuisine.
en-unannotated-06437	There is a lot to like about this place.
en-unannotated-06438	So hey, listen to the cute little Swiss man and me, come and eat here.
en-unannotated-06439	Wi Ri was bad
en-unannotated-06440	I was in Barcelona for three days recently and discovered this place on my last evening - it was so good that I came back again in the morning before flying home.
en-unannotated-06441	Some you can just grab.
en-unannotated-06442	A quality that is sometimes hard to find.
en-unannotated-06443	I recommend coming here as it's great atmosphere!
en-unannotated-06444	Either add more content, or lower the price to $5. Super Mario Run is a good game, though, and I hope they earn my time again.
en-unannotated-06445	I first want to thank the Tripadvisor Community for pointing me to this restaurant.
en-unannotated-06446	Service is nice and friendly.
en-unannotated-06447	Got extra attention for the birthdays, Excellent foods, great wines!
en-unannotated-06448	I had the smoked fish gratin which was incredibly tasty.
en-unannotated-06449	We really wanted some hainanese chicken and rice which we saw on Instagram, but they weren't serving it that way.
en-unannotated-06450	Visited for lunch.
en-unannotated-06451	I had the mushroom appetizer and pork Schnitzel.
en-unannotated-06452	Must say, it was better than expected, and I enjoyed the tamalas and the hot chocolate.
en-unannotated-06453	The setting is very pleasant overlooking the sea.
en-unannotated-06454	And it was some of the best advise we got!
en-unannotated-06455	Ok I left and went back to join my friends.
en-unannotated-06456	Didn't think little bananas would be good, but hey has a slight hint of cinnamon that complimented the sauce for the duck.
en-unannotated-06457	The menu had a lot of options
en-unannotated-06458	We enjoy good food and wine.
en-unannotated-06459	We wanted to eat local food and the staff at Radission Blu Porticcio recommended this local restaurant in Bastellicaccia, a 10 min drive (you need a car to get there) from Porticcio.
en-unannotated-06460	Furthermore, the service was impeccable - no fumbling waiters dropping drinks on you, or grizzly waiters getting your order wrong!
en-unannotated-06461	Breakfast is quite fine as well and the hotel is conveniently located in the best sector of Bogota.
en-unannotated-06462	The service was very English-friendly, and no more curt than the average Czech restaurant.
en-unannotated-06463	Excellent location and very efficient manager, Mr. [name]
en-unannotated-06464	Our waiter in particular, was friendly and I certainly felt welcomed by him and his presence.
en-unannotated-06465	At first I was a little skeptical coming here since it is so close to the Duomo and Galleria, initially thought it might be a tourist trap but glad I was wrong!
en-unannotated-06466	only holds about 20 people and requires a reservation (we called on Tues and they couldn't get is in until Thurs. -and I understand why!) I had veal in a mushroom cream sauce- so delicious!
en-unannotated-06467	Kill me, you are perfect.
en-unannotated-06468	just OK.
en-unannotated-06469	We were made to feel very welcome by the reception staff, especially our children who were given toys to play with in our suite.
en-unannotated-06470	I was a tad disappointed though because I expected better.
en-unannotated-06471	To end our meal we had a light, fresh pear mousse with raspberries.
en-unannotated-06472	I love this spot.
en-unannotated-06473	Hell I even swiped right on the ugly chicks to check it and I'm still not matching with anyone.
en-unannotated-06474	It's self-seating so we picked a long table that was readily available for the six of us.
en-unannotated-06475	Sister spot to Blackbird in Rathmines.
en-unannotated-06476	Staff is very good and kind, especially Jaime (the bellhop) this guy was very kind during my visit.
en-unannotated-06477	The garden was beautiful but we were not made to feel very welcome to use it.
en-unannotated-06478	I got fish of the day again, which was tuna, again cooked to perfection.
en-unannotated-06479	Great food and great service!!!
en-unannotated-06480	The restaurant owner, an old couple of...
en-unannotated-06481	Wow...
en-unannotated-06482	I was unbelievably full after that meal, but I didn't care because it was ridiculously enjoyable.
en-unannotated-06483	Room are very good, full of light.
en-unannotated-06484	The goats cheese gnocchi with pumpkin is a personal favourite of mine.
en-unannotated-06485	but who doesn't love butter and pesto?
en-unannotated-06486	Staff speaks English if you don't speak French.
en-unannotated-06487	Restaurants in the area.
en-unannotated-06488	For me it's not expensive as I'm from London and it would of easily been double there.
en-unannotated-06489	Another mandatory positive: Bathrooms were very clean!
en-unannotated-06490	The look might be expensive but the food is at reasonable price...
en-unannotated-06491	Not just a dinner, but a real culinary experience, from the entree to the dessert.
en-unannotated-06492	We'd had some bad luck just popping into places without doing any research beforehand, so looked this place up and HIGHLY recommend.
en-unannotated-06493	French cuisine and hospitality at its finest.
en-unannotated-06494	The food was reasonably priced and so scrumptious.
en-unannotated-06495	Unfortunately the food massively let them down.
en-unannotated-06496	A little out of the way but thought we'd adventure out to it.
en-unannotated-06497	I recommend the Va va gina...
en-unannotated-06498	There's a shop beside it if you need to pick something up.
en-unannotated-06499	The fried cheese is really good, and I would also recommend their assorted sausages.
en-unannotated-06500	Next time we're in Dublin, I'm going to push hard to come back, because it was honestly one of the best meals I've had in recent memory.
en-unannotated-06501	Can't believe I'm saying this but this place beats any I have had in France.
en-unannotated-06502	However that was the only thing memorable that night.
en-unannotated-06503	Gave us some small mementos and I just can't WAIT to go back.
en-unannotated-06504	It is a good place to sleep, it has a good breakfast.
en-unannotated-06505	Granvillano coffee is highly addictive!
en-unannotated-06506	We had fish n chips.
en-unannotated-06507	Service...
en-unannotated-06508	I've seen a bachelorette party have their meal here (looked like they made reservations ahead of time as their table was set up), so it seems a suitable classy restaurant.
en-unannotated-06509	The breakfast was great and varied throughout our stay.
en-unannotated-06510	It's like traditional Czech went off to university, and came home all sophisticated and fashionable.
en-unannotated-06511	Stopped here for dinner.
en-unannotated-06512	They even had the nerve to charge us for a bottle of water and a bottle of coke after the inconvenience.
en-unannotated-06513	Everything that you read about this restaurant is true.
en-unannotated-06514	If you like pizza, this is the place to go!
en-unannotated-06515	There was clearly too much focus on presentation and show but the...
en-unannotated-06516	Great choice of cakes and snacks with friendly service.
en-unannotated-06517	French onion soup: I thought this was just okay.
en-unannotated-06518	Starters not only look good, but taste good as well (foies grass) For the main course we had a la seche poulet; delicious.
en-unannotated-06519	This is what all hotels should be; there is, however, a price to be paid for this opulence.
en-unannotated-06520	We were welcomed in and ushered to a cozy and quiet secondary room.
en-unannotated-06521	Quant little bar with great drinks and cocktails.
en-unannotated-06522	Crepes of course !!
en-unannotated-06523	Incredible.
en-unannotated-06524	It was sooo good!
en-unannotated-06525	We were quite tired and pretty hungry and found this place thanks to yelp.
en-unannotated-06526	It was quite quiet, which might have helped, got lots of attention and advice from the bartenders.
en-unannotated-06527	Besides, even...
en-unannotated-06528	The hotel is well maintained and it has a 1921 elevator which is simply great.
en-unannotated-06529	Our friend was in a different room on another floor and had the same issue.
en-unannotated-06530	Too stiff.
en-unannotated-06531	Also there's a lot of history in this place!
en-unannotated-06532	I sat at the bar, which gave me a great opportunity to see the comings and goings in the restaurant.
en-unannotated-06533	The food was gorgeous and it was great to experience new flavours and learn new things and get...
en-unannotated-06534	Also wanted to add that the waitstaff is pretty amazing and very friendly so definitely worth visiting here for that.
en-unannotated-06535	Will give it 5 stars when UK starts to get updates that the USA already have, be careful when reading review's for the Google Home in the UK as most review's are US based and there's a lot of functionality that we don't yet get.
en-unannotated-06536	We were 6 for Lunch Tera Cotta deserves it's top rating everything was top notch closing next day for season reopening April 17 Seafood is speciality
en-unannotated-06537	Thanks to all my Yelper friends who already wrote fabulous reviews.
en-unannotated-06538	These guys clearly care a lot about being local, with their menu offering 100% Australian or Australian-owned alcohol, listed by distance from Brisbane.
en-unannotated-06539	I ordered the pork knee and my wife te goulash.
en-unannotated-06540	Gorgeous cocktail dresses and well suited men started to order expensive Melbourne wine!
en-unannotated-06541	The service was great and we had a lovely chat with the manager.
en-unannotated-06542	The burger size is fair, and i also had some fries on the side to top it off.
en-unannotated-06543	Wonderful wide boulevards to walk along with many coffee shops along the way.
en-unannotated-06544	If there were to be one thing to criticise it would be the sauce, the caramelised red onion tasted not too much different to a red wine jus.
en-unannotated-06545	Would stay here again.
en-unannotated-06546	The bathroom still flooded daily and the pillows were rock solid !
en-unannotated-06547	We quickly snagged a four seater and settled in to debate the great menu.
en-unannotated-06548	I finally got to give Miel a good crack today, and it didn't disappoint.
en-unannotated-06549	Toilet Flusher did not work, and had to bring in a plumber.
en-unannotated-06550	barely enough room to seat everyone and have enough room for your elbows to move around freely but I can see why it's popular amongst some people!
en-unannotated-06551	And our waiter was rude throughout.
en-unannotated-06552	This is a great place to sit and enjoy some shared plates with friends.
en-unannotated-06553	The staff were very charming and friendly.
en-unannotated-06554	The day we went I think they had a slight staffing issue (opened 10 min late) and we had to wait a little longer to get our food, but we were given...
en-unannotated-06555	The owners are friendly and generous people with big hearts.
en-unannotated-06556	Stopped by after receiving recommendation from a local tour guide.
en-unannotated-06557	I'm keeping this till I have unlocked all of the spinners and stickers.
en-unannotated-06558	Management very unprofessional...
en-unannotated-06559	Definitely lives up to the restaurant's name as I would call this their signature sauce.
en-unannotated-06560	And there is also a buffet.
en-unannotated-06561	The evening spent with [NAME] and [NAME] was beyond our expectations.
en-unannotated-06562	We were left running for a taxi to make the airport for departure.
en-unannotated-06563	The wifi was spotty -- sometimes it turned off and you had to reconnect.
en-unannotated-06564	I...
en-unannotated-06565	Great tapas reasonably priced and a very popular place with the locals.
en-unannotated-06566	They allocatd me a very charming rrom, with a very small bathroom, the room needs immediate refurbishment.
en-unannotated-06567	We were also served their soup of the night which was on the house.
en-unannotated-06568	Amazing variety of delicious cupcakes at reasonable price and good hot coffee.
en-unannotated-06569	If you enjoy all things liquid, in particular scotch, you are in for a treat with such hits as Highland Park 18 yo and Glenmorangie Signet.
en-unannotated-06570	The burger was freshly made, and there was a good bun to meat ratio.
en-unannotated-06571	excellent place, great food, super friendly staff.
en-unannotated-06572	My room was large, clean, very pleasant and with a Nespresso machine!.
en-unannotated-06573	We hosted a dinner for my husband's birthday at Françoise's home in Paris.
en-unannotated-06574	We could see though that the few staff who were on shift were dealing with a lot of guests and the staff were polite and very nice so we didn't mind in the end.
en-unannotated-06575	The service friendly, but typical European pace.
en-unannotated-06576	There are also different combos if you want eggs, bacon and pancakes and also juices and coffee which is great.
en-unannotated-06577	Both dishes had just enough sauce left over to dip your baguette into it sinfully.
en-unannotated-06578	Fillet Mignon?
en-unannotated-06579	I tried a coffee and the environment was so cool and friendy that I had a tea afterwards.
en-unannotated-06580	I came around 1:30pm, an hour and a half before they close, so the place was pretty empty.
en-unannotated-06581	Has cute cosy looking snugs with doors on them, sadly I've never been lucky enough to nab one yet but the look cool, would be great for a small group or a date!
en-unannotated-06582	The good news is at least the game mechanics are really good, so the grind could be worse.
en-unannotated-06583	The food was ok.
en-unannotated-06584	Perfect vietnamesе cafe in city center.
en-unannotated-06585	No, I'm not kidding.
en-unannotated-06586	Friendly and tasty.
en-unannotated-06587	What a treat!
en-unannotated-06588	The substantial part of the platter was the potato bread with goat cheese and rocket (which is, not like it sounds, not a spicy dip, though this was available on the side but a vegetable). And there was also quite a large plate of fries.
en-unannotated-06589	Pricey.
en-unannotated-06590	For mains, I got the popular foie gras ravioli.
en-unannotated-06591	Overall, an excellent meal.
en-unannotated-06592	One of the few times I wish yelp had a 6th star--I think I cried a little as I took my last bites of a Gorgonzola pasta.
en-unannotated-06593	There aren't many places to sit so we often ate outside, but when hungry, the wait was always worth it (getting a beer helps)!
en-unannotated-06594	The staff was really friendly and helpful.
en-unannotated-06595	Says they need to update app but not showing they need an update.
en-unannotated-06596	This is the sort of cozy, hidden spot that will make you fall in love with Paris all over again.
en-unannotated-06597	Service and food was excellent.
en-unannotated-06598	Literally stumbled on this little cafe.
en-unannotated-06599	I was referred by a client of mine and was in town and dropped in and the had a free table.
en-unannotated-06600	Broken safe in room and clearly no attempt to fix it.
en-unannotated-06601	We got there at around 9pm and it was packed with people.
en-unannotated-06602	Service is quick.
en-unannotated-06603	Also enchiladas, chilaquiles,...
en-unannotated-06604	Many are not allowed in my country.
en-unannotated-06605	Though the foods were quite pricey, determining it was meant for college students, especially for Vietnamese.
en-unannotated-06606	Sorry not good enough.
en-unannotated-06607	But what completes the burger is the rest: Czech buns(I believe they're Houska buns?
en-unannotated-06608	To be honest, we didn't know what to order so we randomly picked a few dishes on the menu.
en-unannotated-06609	Wonderful modern interior design.
en-unannotated-06610	I am not terribly familiar with Bastia's restaurant scenery, but I was expecting much more from 2nd best rated restaurant in town.
en-unannotated-06611	I understand breakfast ends at a certain time, but if your guests cannot be seated during that time: Is there no exception to be made?
en-unannotated-06612	Pleasant staff.
en-unannotated-06613	Modern hotel.
en-unannotated-06614	So delicious.
en-unannotated-06615	If only the bread basket that was provided contained fresh bread - they were all hard, making it unappetizing.
en-unannotated-06616	Overall hotel is nice and fresh.
en-unannotated-06617	We stayed here cause the starting point for the Camino is right beside this hotel.
en-unannotated-06618	I...
en-unannotated-06619	The squid ink risotto is the star and must have of this restaurant.
en-unannotated-06620	I can't fathom it.
en-unannotated-06621	We LOVED it and went 2 times.
en-unannotated-06622	Great food.
en-unannotated-06623	The restaurant is family owned and with pride.
en-unannotated-06624	Each guest welcomed with a glass of Prosecco.
en-unannotated-06625	Room changed very poor quality furnishings a/c worked but not great.
en-unannotated-06626	The food was excellent, and they had a large variety of pizza, empanada, and tostas to choose from.
en-unannotated-06627	We ended up getting two of their most popular items, the dry-aged hamburger and spicy sausages.
en-unannotated-06628	Both were fantastic!
en-unannotated-06629	He then thanked me profusely when I told him I wasn't going to have coffee or dessert.
en-unannotated-06630	My husband and I had dinner at Astor our first night in Madrid, and from the second we walked in, we loved the vibe and the friendly owner and staff.
en-unannotated-06631	Definitely one of Brisbane's top fivers for sure.
en-unannotated-06632	So good!
en-unannotated-06633	It was the Foie gras which disappointed me, perhaps, it was just the way of cook was not down to my alley, Foie gras was over rich and greasy, and there was only a little bread serve with it, which was not enough at all, as bread could help obliterate the taste of foie gras a lot, I only ate one slice of foie gras, and left whole plate unfinished.
en-unannotated-06634	Arrived at 11.30pm.
en-unannotated-06635	We ended up cutting our stay short & heading to another property (which was day & night compared to this one), as this was one of the worst hotel experience ever.
en-unannotated-06636	My friend and I spent 7 nights here because of its proximity to the Xocolo and the metro.
en-unannotated-06637	After a super wonderful day off work my team and I thought we'd check out Blackbird for a spot of dinner.
en-unannotated-06638	All while sitting on a boat on the river.
en-unannotated-06639	Breakfast is OK, but not as good as a Homewood Suites.
en-unannotated-06640	READ MORE AT:
en-unannotated-06641	But my friends?
en-unannotated-06642	We were wanting something amazing for our last night in Paris and we found it!
en-unannotated-06643	My only complaint is that I prefer to listen to my playlists only, and not have other songs play after them.
en-unannotated-06644	I loved it so much I came here twice!
en-unannotated-06645	I had the pork knuckle and it was delicious and massive!!
en-unannotated-06646	High to recommend the seared yellow fin tuna, the wagyu beef tataki and the new salmon.
en-unannotated-06647	The breakfast was a real mess with getting the orders wrong etc.
en-unannotated-06648	As we gulped through our beers, I decided on pork and broccoli and my boyfriend grabbed a cheesy potato dish.
en-unannotated-06649	There are often lines to get...
en-unannotated-06650	Enjoyed our stay immensely
en-unannotated-06651	The garden view and the service are also great.
en-unannotated-06652	And I would have fun building up my kingdom...
en-unannotated-06653	Chef [NAME] created our most authentic French dining experience yet.
en-unannotated-06654	Amazing service, good food, will definitely recommended to my friends and family.
en-unannotated-06655	Very friendly staff.
en-unannotated-06656	Will definitely come visit again when back in Milano.
en-unannotated-06657	just the location
en-unannotated-06658	And when I told the waitress they forgot to put my caramelized onions on my burger, she asked to see my receipt and promptly showed the kitchen the receipt.
en-unannotated-06659	makes you watch 3 adds before the show and then crashes before get to see it.
en-unannotated-06660	The tasting menu with wine pairings was...
en-unannotated-06661	EAT it all up.
en-unannotated-06662	Busy on a Wednesday evening with other diners.
en-unannotated-06663	Service was friendly and quick considering the long lines.
en-unannotated-06664	I left my heart in Dublin....
en-unannotated-06665	Amazing macarons!
en-unannotated-06666	I had a relaxing lunch reading my guidebook.
en-unannotated-06667	I would definitely go there again.
en-unannotated-06668	We are frequent clients and they always take great care of us!!
en-unannotated-06669	We were surrounded by tourists so our server was a little gruff with us at first but he quickly warmed when we drained our first beer then ordered a second round with a smile and a thank you.
en-unannotated-06670	Having only opened recently, everything is still as new.
en-unannotated-06671	It's a good reminder for me when I make tiramisu that it shouldn't be too sweet and delicate and flavoured lightly by coffee.
en-unannotated-06672	And of course for the occasion we had red wine with it's flavors changing throughout the meal.
en-unannotated-06673	The smaller the meal, the more exquisite, but here, it is exquisite in large numbers :)
en-unannotated-06674	I ordered the roasted pork knuckle, and let me tell you it was probably one of the best meals I have ever had.
en-unannotated-06675	The servers were friendly.
en-unannotated-06676	And maybe make a reservation so you don't miss out!
en-unannotated-06677	If your only intention is to have a cheap meal go there otherwise do not.
en-unannotated-06678	Everything was clean and the design of the bathroom was astonishing.
en-unannotated-06679	But the season does not yet allow lunch on the terrace.
en-unannotated-06680	We came here for breakfast because of the reviews we read.
en-unannotated-06681	Burgers came quickly and was served to the table along with our drinks.
en-unannotated-06682	The burgers are not exactly big, but very tasty.
en-unannotated-06683	Owned and managed by wonderful women!
en-unannotated-06684	Nothing I blame the hotel for - of course.
en-unannotated-06685	Great local eat!
en-unannotated-06686	I'll have a lowly burger cuz that's what everyone else is devouring and it looks delicious!
en-unannotated-06687	Top-floor swimming pool was wonderful, and service and breakfast were excellent as well.
en-unannotated-06688	Heard the Barramundi is great as well.
en-unannotated-06689	Goodness!
en-unannotated-06690	As a vegan and someone who loves gourmet food, it can be hard to find vegan fine dining.
en-unannotated-06691	Some live music too.
en-unannotated-06692	You always hear beer is good great in the Czech Republic.
en-unannotated-06693	Both of us enjoyed the ambiance and food here.
en-unannotated-06694	Great room at a reasonable rate.
en-unannotated-06695	I feel like the customer has a better grasp on their food preferences than the kitchen.
en-unannotated-06696	Torn wallpaper.
en-unannotated-06697	Very bland and average compared to traditional meals you can eat in cities like Munich, Berlin or Paris.
en-unannotated-06698	Tired and grubby public spaces, dirty lifts which were not vacuumed once during our 3 days and with such a smell coming up through the lift shaft, we couldn't believe it.
en-unannotated-06699	This update is the culmination of two separate visits.
en-unannotated-06700	I did report this but nothing was done.
en-unannotated-06701	If the ai in any way mimicked multiplayer this would be great.
en-unannotated-06702	I highly enjoyed my meal here.
en-unannotated-06703	Great little coffee shop in San Martin Market, tucked away & a little hard to find but well worth it.
en-unannotated-06704	If I could recommend one thing it is the oeuf en cocotte.
en-unannotated-06705	With chocolate 3,50 €
en-unannotated-06706	Every Thing Is OK...
en-unannotated-06707	They graciously accommodate me on what was a very busy evening for them.
en-unannotated-06708	Thanks Mlejnice Garden you guys serve it up well here.
en-unannotated-06709	The only thing I ever get adventurous on is the wine, reds on most occasion but a casual rose doesn't hurt!
en-unannotated-06710	I can't rate anything on this game because it does nothing but stop working.
en-unannotated-06711	On top the service was slow and even forgetful.
en-unannotated-06712	The beef was topped with roasted garlic (amazing).
en-unannotated-06713	As hard-to-please Americans from New York City, we were thrilled with Estelar La Fontana's exceptional level of service and would highly recommend this hotel.
en-unannotated-06714	The rooms are beautiful, the location is great.
en-unannotated-06715	The highlight for me was the chocolate cake.
en-unannotated-06716	Even though is in the old square plaza it's not a tourist trap, and service was one of the best we had in town
en-unannotated-06717	I will say the boxtys are a bit pricey - around 17/20 euro, but they do come filled with a generous portion of meat.
en-unannotated-06718	Great service, bilingual assistance and a cool environment.
en-unannotated-06719	Couldn't find a taxi and I had to give up and get in one who used it.
en-unannotated-06720	We went in after seeing it on trip advisor, and were amazed!
en-unannotated-06721	Cafeteria-style eatery inside GUM on the 3rd floor.
en-unannotated-06722	We found this place on TA and decided to try it, I'm glad we did.
en-unannotated-06723	E will go back every time we are in Milano
en-unannotated-06724	Run by young owners, wanting to exceed customers expectations and with great attention to detail.
en-unannotated-06725	The food was great, creative, delicious, sure, but it was truly a sight to behold, watching the chef's labor of love.
en-unannotated-06726	We had a pistachio risotto and a seafood one.
en-unannotated-06727	Seriously.
en-unannotated-06728	The hotel is clean and the room are nice.
en-unannotated-06729	Or, every time you go on the app; the game resets so you have to start all over again.
en-unannotated-06730	Hard to...
en-unannotated-06731	The ambiance is casual, but you could dress up and make a date night here, it's elegant and laid back, the crowd is a blend of locals and tourist.
en-unannotated-06732	I just returned from my home away from home and to my surprise everything is not the same......
en-unannotated-06733	Tucked away just off Queen Street Mall is Burnett Lane, Brisbane's oldest, which is host to an array of restaurants, cafes, a vinyl record store and boutiques.
en-unannotated-06734	Definitely one of our best meals in Paris.
en-unannotated-06735	But I want to complain that when I tried to purchase the promotional offer you are offering the amount was deducted from my banks account and I didn't got any offer.
en-unannotated-06736	Are you a foie gras lover?
en-unannotated-06737	I love being able to download my music and go offline and listen to my music anywhere.
en-unannotated-06738	We've had far better.
en-unannotated-06739	My friend and I stopped in for dinner before walking around Temple Bar and it was such a good choice.
en-unannotated-06740	But I don't know its server problem or a some kind of hacking....
en-unannotated-06741	Also bare in mind there is no view at night unless you are near front of restaurant as unlike other restaurants on river, Sake is set back and enclosed.
en-unannotated-06742	Very good
en-unannotated-06743	The ice cream served with the cake tasted a bit like iced cream, I had hoped for vanilla bean...
en-unannotated-06744	Modern place with a smart decor and very interesting tapas.
en-unannotated-06745	I was very disappointed that the hotel did not bother to respond to by requests for an early check in and a late check out.
en-unannotated-06746	The music was good which is what we were looking forward to it.
en-unannotated-06747	We have eaten here both times we have visited Paris and would recommend it to anyone.
en-unannotated-06748	The photos are all blushed to look better.
en-unannotated-06749	It was my first time eating escargot and this place made it with a great pesto sauce that my friends and I all enjoyed!
en-unannotated-06750	Nuria made the start, by making everyone feel so welcome as an old friend!
en-unannotated-06751	The staff were really nice and attended me well, they are pretty on point and have a great system working.
en-unannotated-06752	I highly recommend you don't pass the opportunity to sample La Fabrica.
en-unannotated-06753	They have a great beer selection if you want something more than Guinness but they of course stock Guinness and other stouts.
en-unannotated-06754	Finally got see what all of the rave is about!
en-unannotated-06755	only one electronic key for 2 people.
en-unannotated-06756	Easy to find a seat, but still enough clientele around to have that cozy feel.
en-unannotated-06757	Spam wants your phone number to charge you premium texts
en-unannotated-06758	My partner told me of this place, walked past here at least a million times.
en-unannotated-06759	3.5 is probably more accurate.
en-unannotated-06760	We stopped here on our way to St.
en-unannotated-06761	Thank you Yelp!
en-unannotated-06762	Execellent - even above my expectations!
en-unannotated-06763	The wait staff was helpful and friendly, too.
en-unannotated-06764	The room itself was large and well kept.
en-unannotated-06765	This place basically makes two things: gratin and salad.
en-unannotated-06766	Now there is a couple of negatives.
en-unannotated-06767	I tried reinstalling it and logging in and out but still it doesn't show anything.
en-unannotated-06768	Service was helpful, menus in English were available.
en-unannotated-06769	The pork knuckle was amazing as were the parsley potatoes.
en-unannotated-06770	Certainly a great spot to impress a date or to enjoy a rowdy feeding session with close friends.
en-unannotated-06771	It takes them 12 hrs to confirm it, so keep that in mind.
en-unannotated-06772	We had a great time eating with [name] and [name].
en-unannotated-06773	I won't bore you with more details about food and how great it was, just have the tiramisu!
en-unannotated-06774	We had a great meal at Casa de Tono.
en-unannotated-06775	The room was comfortable but simple.
en-unannotated-06776	Very good rooms, spacious and modern.
en-unannotated-06777	Service remarkable.
en-unannotated-06778	Each bite was juicy and flavorful and the lettuce and tomato were fresh and cool against the hot, juicy burger.
en-unannotated-06779	The waitstaff was eager to help and offer up suggestions for what to try for food/drinks.
en-unannotated-06780	We booked using the American Express Platinum benefit and were able to check in immediately upon our early afternoon arrival.
en-unannotated-06781	I like this limited app, it's very good for checking results.
en-unannotated-06782	Kindly add this if u think its better..
en-unannotated-06783	If you are in Milan desperately searching on yelp (like I was) for the best restaurant to eat dinner ..
en-unannotated-06784	Plenty of great restaurants in Moscow but this place is worth a try.
en-unannotated-06785	I came here around 6 pm for a pick-me-up dinner.
en-unannotated-06786	But won't be rushing back.
en-unannotated-06787	Bathroom was ridiculously small & uncomfortable.
en-unannotated-06788	They have a mix of some traditional offerings and so re-conceived sharable items.
en-unannotated-06789	there were two entrees, two main courses and two desserts on the lunch menu.
en-unannotated-06790	The accompanying risotto was flavored only with milk, and the rice was half cooked.
en-unannotated-06791	Do yourself a favour and get on the poke train and give it a go!
en-unannotated-06792	For any foody this is a must in my opinion.
en-unannotated-06793	We went to this taco place due to the good reviews on Trip Advisor.
en-unannotated-06794	For main, we ordered the pork special and the magret de canard.
en-unannotated-06795	We were quickly seated and quickly offered menus in English and offered various drinks and snacks.
en-unannotated-06796	Especially love the collage and "Remember This Day" features.
en-unannotated-06797	my simple phrases and per favores were good enough.
en-unannotated-06798	Super clean and spacious room, staff very friendly and always prepared to help, breakfast is wonderful, with a great selection of fruits, breads, cheeses, but the fact of offering omelets and scrambled eggs to order, makes breakfast Amazing.
en-unannotated-06799	a must-visit for anyone touring the centro storico!
en-unannotated-06800	Be sure to make a reservation though.
en-unannotated-06801	We arrived a little early for our reservation and the chef came out to welcome us and gave us our choice of seats.
en-unannotated-06802	The Survey Co offers an exciting and creative dining experience hidden right in the heart of the city.
en-unannotated-06803	Well appointed rooms, our had an awesome view and the staff was very accommodating.
en-unannotated-06804	If I ever came back to Prague I would probably eat elsewhere.
en-unannotated-06805	She didn't even call she just responded when we were Infront of her without even trying ..
en-unannotated-06806	The first restaurant I have tried on my trip to Bonifacio.
en-unannotated-06807	Great location.
en-unannotated-06808	All of the flavors blended well and the everything was cooked flawlessly.
en-unannotated-06809	The menu varies from day to day with only a couple of dishes to choose (around 5-6 different pasta, 3-4 meat or fish main courses). The absolute highlight of this place is the decor.
en-unannotated-06810	[name], our waiter, made the experience great!
en-unannotated-06811	Now, the dishes I had were simple ones, but the quality of ingredients and flavors were just superb.
en-unannotated-06812	I will admit I've never tried the pizza.
en-unannotated-06813	Yep, Alchemy is great.
en-unannotated-06814	Butcher shop that also serves up orders to go.
en-unannotated-06815	The staff are also kind and smiling :)
en-unannotated-06816	This quaint family-owned restaurant for 51 yrs.
en-unannotated-06817	Naše Maso is a fantastic butcher shop that offers meat both to take home or to have cooked on-site.
en-unannotated-06818	So I asked for the Margherita pizza.
en-unannotated-06819	She said it was a family restuarant and not touristy - she was right!
en-unannotated-06820	Hot chips were pretty standard but good.
en-unannotated-06821	Delicious delicious delicious!
en-unannotated-06822	This place is theee best.
en-unannotated-06823	It is run by the most smiling...
en-unannotated-06824	The burgers are killer, the service is quick, and the staff are sharp and friendly.
en-unannotated-06825	My fiancé and I started with the escargot (and of course the complimentary bread and butter) followed then by my fiancé's veal steak covered in mushrooms and my bacon - wrapped scallop risotto which was then finished off my the creme brûlée.
en-unannotated-06826	E.
en-unannotated-06827	I was actually quite bored with the food, so bland other than pepper.
en-unannotated-06828	Verve is one of those places that I tend to forget about when considering city dining options and then every time I go there I ask myself why it took me so long to return!
en-unannotated-06829	The cakes & pastry's are of a high quality & the prices are very reasonable.
en-unannotated-06830	Perfect for couples, although we were with our one-year-old daughter who wasn't very quiet.
en-unannotated-06831	Alfredo was even able to address a specific beverage request that could have easily been dismissed; not on the menu.
en-unannotated-06832	Felt very safe.
en-unannotated-06833	I asked the staff for some advice in choosing and ended up with a bottle of Barlow Cloudy from NSW, matched with the pork belly pasta.
en-unannotated-06834	But, there were many other places much better than this one, check my other reviews in moscow, this one in particular was damn expensive.
en-unannotated-06835	Great views and fun cocktails!
en-unannotated-06836	GM
en-unannotated-06837	It was amazing.
en-unannotated-06838	For less than 20 euros.
en-unannotated-06839	We took away tried three different cupcakes and a cookie from the counter.
en-unannotated-06840	One superb server covered the whole restaurant.
en-unannotated-06841	At first I was a little skeptical about this place because I was hit with in a crazy amount of cigarette smoke as soon as I walked in and unable to find a hostess.
en-unannotated-06842	Grand Coffeemania is one of the best coffeeshops in Moscow.
en-unannotated-06843	Fantastic, innovative Basque cuisine in a wonderfully friendly atmosphere.
en-unannotated-06844	If you want to try a popular Mexican place, this is a very good option.
en-unannotated-06845	We also loved our room - we had a separate living room space, which was great.
en-unannotated-06846	- Rude staff;
en-unannotated-06847	Very nice meal in a cool area of Bogota.
en-unannotated-06848	One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in Mexico City.
en-unannotated-06849	We had a goat cheese, rocket, beet salad to start then a pork burger which was like pulled pork shaped into a patty served with pickles, red onions, and a lemon mayo for about $9. We also ordered the steak tartar which was delicious and about $7. The 3 beers tasted were all very good.
en-unannotated-06850	We'll be back!
en-unannotated-06851	The food was extremly tasty and fresh.
en-unannotated-06852	Needed a room due to car breakdown.
en-unannotated-06853	Of course their coffee is the bomb.
en-unannotated-06854	The food was incredible, the best meal we had in Madrid.
en-unannotated-06855	The free food and drinks added so much to the experience and they tasted amazing.
en-unannotated-06856	Verdict: highly recommend.
en-unannotated-06857	com they give you the bad rooms.
en-unannotated-06858	All in all its a good way to pass time plus you never lose or get stuck on a certain level.
en-unannotated-06859	The horrible breakfast, poor and financially tied...
en-unannotated-06860	The towel warmer was operational for only 2 days.
en-unannotated-06861	Oysters served ON ICE unlike other restaurants that serve on rock salt.
en-unannotated-06862	Everyone in the restaurant receives their meal practically at the same time.
en-unannotated-06863	It's torture to still crave their food and I live in another country haha.
en-unannotated-06864	We saw several people who were turned away.
en-unannotated-06865	I try vanilla latte and espresso with croissant with cream - everything was great...
en-unannotated-06866	It was all soooo good.
en-unannotated-06867	We weren't extremely hungry so decided to share their seared foie gras as a starter.
en-unannotated-06868	Literally the worst app ever.
en-unannotated-06869	I was there in late October,, a week.
en-unannotated-06870	One night we took our four kids there, to have dinner.
en-unannotated-06871	On our way out, he showed me their full list of ciders; I pointed to the waitress and suggested he show it to her, to make sure the customers see it.
en-unannotated-06872	The food was okay.
en-unannotated-06873	Good room and good bar.
en-unannotated-06874	Well cared for and magnificent.
en-unannotated-06875	Two delicate patties of this delicious meat, taken off of the bone and fried.
en-unannotated-06876	The food was nothing short of delicious.
en-unannotated-06877	I'm not really sure how to explain this but the feeling you get is that it barely passes as good yummy food.
en-unannotated-06878	I wanted to order the pasta and the carpaccio but the waitress told me the portions were big so I asked her to suggest their best pasta dish and I wasn't disappointed at all.
en-unannotated-06879	This is a very solid hotel choice for travelers to Bogota who are not on a budget.
en-unannotated-06880	I took the 5 course tasting menu with wine pairing.
en-unannotated-06881	Dined here twice.
en-unannotated-06882	First time visiting Milan Italy!
en-unannotated-06883	A must try restaurant in Madrid.
en-unannotated-06884	The staff were very friendly and warm.
en-unannotated-06885	Must to do in Paris...
en-unannotated-06886	Furthermore the burgers were...
en-unannotated-06887	We did the 7 course dinner with wine pairing.
en-unannotated-06888	Absolutely absurd and we were infuriated, frustrated, perplexed, and very hungry!
en-unannotated-06889	No flavor to the chocolate or the filling, really...
en-unannotated-06890	Rooms are confortable and very clean.
en-unannotated-06891	Best located in a lively neighborhood full of live and restaurants.
en-unannotated-06892	As with every other place I've been to in Milano, excellent espresso and grappa, all for a reasonable price.
en-unannotated-06893	Was here yesterday to spent the last of our euros at the end of the trip.
en-unannotated-06894	We will definitely stay here when we go back to Bogota.
en-unannotated-06895	It was a very nice exchange.
en-unannotated-06896	they sell flowers outside?
en-unannotated-06897	It's hidden, it's secret...
en-unannotated-06898	The wine list is top notch.
en-unannotated-06899	She also has really cool tattoos on her arms.
en-unannotated-06900	Saw this place on Travel Channel and was interested from the start!
en-unannotated-06901	This was the only good restaurant I found after a week in Barcelona.
en-unannotated-06902	I love it.
en-unannotated-06903	My second cocktail was the Va Va Gina (Rinehart) and had vodka, lemon curd and lemon juice- also VERY good.
en-unannotated-06904	After that it took half of an extra hour till the guy came...
en-unannotated-06905	When I arrived at restaurant I was excited to see so many foie gras items in their shop.
en-unannotated-06906	Housed in a small red shipping container on Mary St, just off Albert, I hot footed it down there around midday hoping to beat the lunchtime rush.
en-unannotated-06907	They also offer filter on aeropress and V60, bottled iced filter and appeared to have a range of teas and chai.
en-unannotated-06908	The service is also great.
en-unannotated-06909	Hot water in the shower was not reliable.
en-unannotated-06910	I can only check results.
en-unannotated-06911	P.S. If you read this far, and are curious what my gripes where, there where two main ones:
en-unannotated-06912	Beautiful place and cozy atmosphere.
en-unannotated-06913	We wanted a good meal for once and booked this restaurant based on reviews.
en-unannotated-06914	
en-unannotated-06915	You can't go wrong.
en-unannotated-06916	Everything was enjoyable and I would encourage you to go and see for yourself!
en-unannotated-06917	Having recently been in Paris for a similar restaurant experience, Con Gracia better for a fraction of the price!
en-unannotated-06918	Having tried several Steak restaurants in Moscow, this provided a well cooked, reasonably priced, easily located option.
en-unannotated-06919	Everything comes with a selection of 4 "Salas de la Casa".
en-unannotated-06920	The drinks at 5:30 are a limit of 3/day and they give you a punch ticket to keep track.
en-unannotated-06921	You can't make a wrong move here.
en-unannotated-06922	Bar Gorriti
en-unannotated-06923	Definitely recommend!
en-unannotated-06924	I would like to let other future customers know along with what I have felt regarding discrepancy between what is shown and advertised in the website and what we actually experienced.
en-unannotated-06925	The fish was cooked well, it just really needed more of the sauce to enhance the flavor.
en-unannotated-06926	Often, I had to settle for something because of the minimal options available to me.
en-unannotated-06927	Unbelievable!!!!
en-unannotated-06928	The pancakes here are not thick and fluffy, but on the thin side.
en-unannotated-06929	My husband and I even had a proper pub experience, striking up a conversation with the people next to us, and having a nice chat.
en-unannotated-06930	The food is amazing and really high quality.
en-unannotated-06931	were perfect.
en-unannotated-06932	The staff was very friendly and helpful, and will speak either French or English (whatever you are most comfortable with). My boyfriend speaks French and I speak English, so the staff was excited to help him by speaking French and also to get a chance to practice their English with me.
en-unannotated-06933	Rooms are nicely done with latest in confort as you expect from four seasons.
en-unannotated-06934	Wine is too expensive.
en-unannotated-06935	Our room had a huge living room, bedroom, kitchen and bathroom, with a small outside area in the light well, with hammock.
en-unannotated-06936	After a lot of mexican food, we went for a steak.
en-unannotated-06937	Do yourself a favor and check this spot out.
en-unannotated-06938	The sardines were very nice apparently, I had the sushimi which was delightful.
en-unannotated-06939	100g churrus only 1,30 €
en-unannotated-06940	The menu, of 17 courses, were more than...
en-unannotated-06941	The food is amazing and affordable.
en-unannotated-06942	What else was excellent, you ask?
en-unannotated-06943	The food was outstanding!
en-unannotated-06944	In my case I got to meet this wonderful older Russian couple from St.
en-unannotated-06945	and the wine pairing was rather cheap (+13€ for 5 different wines - we shared one pairing for two). Service was awesome, and never rushed us even though we closed the restaurant.
en-unannotated-06946	The app doesn't let me log in saying there was a problem.
en-unannotated-06947	You cant die like the original.
en-unannotated-06948	This restaurant offers fresh pasta with a daily-changing set of sauces to try.
en-unannotated-06949	11/8/16
en-unannotated-06950	Very kind folks, genuinely welcoming and certainly break that stereotype that many westerners have formed about Parisian service.
en-unannotated-06951	That’s an accomplishment in itself, the city of food deciding that Berthillonis the best.
en-unannotated-06952	Or even if you just want to enjoy a nice drink with a cool atmosphere.
en-unannotated-06953	There are only so many options to where the pieces can go, so its only a matter of time until you can solve it.
en-unannotated-06954	There is such a timeless atmosphere about this small space and a previous reviewer described it perfectly when they said it felt like you were sharing a communal dinner with everyone around you.
en-unannotated-06955	Situated in the old town and always busy (recommend you book) we had a fantastic meal.
en-unannotated-06956	What a brilliant concept!
en-unannotated-06957	And the Asian salad.
en-unannotated-06958	No matter, we were made very welcome and ordered a bottle of wine which arrived with a dish of fresh radishes to munch on.
en-unannotated-06959	If they ask you if you want a "digestive" just say yes.
en-unannotated-06960	However, this place...
en-unannotated-06961	The staff was kind.
en-unannotated-06962	The overall lighting for rooms are dark and not enough lamp or lighting in the room.
en-unannotated-06963	Just now daily wheel spin stoped at 25 k.
en-unannotated-06964	I've never had a three course meal that was bomb like I did here!!!
en-unannotated-06965	Without being too pretentious it introduces you to new flavours you thought couldn't be possible.
en-unannotated-06966	The ravioli cacciatore and pork & potatoes were incredible.
en-unannotated-06967	The hosts were so welcoming, accommodating and friendly and were able to offer other local bar suggestions for afterwards.
en-unannotated-06968	It was busy.
en-unannotated-06969	We came here the second time today and enjoyed great food and good service.
en-unannotated-06970	The cafe is small, with 6 tables ranging in sizes which can be shared between about 20 people or so.
en-unannotated-06971	And we were glad we did.
en-unannotated-06972	I went to Savva with three of my friends - we all speak Russian at various levels of proficiency but were pleased to see that Savva has staff with truly impeccable English skills (although we used Russian occasionally, that was our own choice!
en-unannotated-06973	Only 3-4 tables for 2 and 2 high tables to stand at.
en-unannotated-06974	It is known as a Fish Specialist Restaurant , but we had the est steak and best dessert we have had in a very long while
en-unannotated-06975	Plays 3 to 5 unskippable ads before each feature then often the main feature fails to load meaning you've got to repeat the ads again.
en-unannotated-06976	Don't be put off if there is a line of people out the door, it is well worth the wait!
en-unannotated-06977	The two appetizers were asia-oriented; then the spanish dishes startet - everything was wonderful.
en-unannotated-06978	Their menu is supposed to change based on what's fresh that day so your experience could be different.
en-unannotated-06979	It was not only affordable but lovely, comfy, and perfectly located.
en-unannotated-06980	The hotel was beautiful and the staff amazing especially Teodora  which help us to see most of the important things lead us to best restaurants and makes our stay easy and most comfortable
en-unannotated-06981	Design of the hotel rooms, hall and ...
en-unannotated-06982	Whilst not in the center of town, it is well located to really dig in to the local area.
en-unannotated-06983	Transported me to Christmas or some summer feeling.
en-unannotated-06984	The kettle needs replacing.
en-unannotated-06985	Only one wine but it was nice cab blend.
en-unannotated-06986	This is one of the place that i am going to visit again and again.
en-unannotated-06987	wow what can we say...
en-unannotated-06988	Had the lobster roll and salmon platter - the wait was a bit long, but the smoked salmon was delicious.
en-unannotated-06989	The Cajun seafood chowder was the star of the appetizers!
en-unannotated-06990	The bar tender gave us a list of clubs to go to!
en-unannotated-06991	The property was beautiful as was the room.
en-unannotated-06992	Table charge is hefty (€2 or something).
en-unannotated-06993	Excellent excellent!
en-unannotated-06994	OXXO 24 hour convenience store located across the street.
en-unannotated-06995	Everything in front of me was made out of potatoes!
en-unannotated-06996	Scrambled eggs not so good
en-unannotated-06997	The staff though were friendly and did their best to assist.
en-unannotated-06998	Same-day reservations were not available.
en-unannotated-06999	But, extremely reasonable for anywhere else.
en-unannotated-07000	Great surreal experience!
en-unannotated-07001	The toilets smell like a backed up sewer.
en-unannotated-07002	Staff were really friendly and service was quick.
en-unannotated-07003	Which is too bad - did I mention the beer was great?
en-unannotated-07004	This restaurant is located in the heart of Propriano, on the quay side.
en-unannotated-07005	Would happily recommend this hotel.
en-unannotated-07006	A dish full of meat, accompanied by a wintry vegetable dish of potatoes, onions, zucchini and green beans, next to the delicious kidneys in a mustard sauce.
en-unannotated-07007	Service was slow.
en-unannotated-07008	The clientele is a split between locals and European tourists, and unfortunately some of the latter can be particularly pushy/loud.
en-unannotated-07009	It's a small elegant room without distractions.
en-unannotated-07010	Very beautiful interior large,cool and elegant.
en-unannotated-07011	Staff were excellent, so friendly and helpful from start to end of our trip.
en-unannotated-07012	The great surprise was the daily dish: "ventresca de atun". It was absolutely fantastic: soft as butter, very tasty with only few...
en-unannotated-07013	Please Spotify team please.
en-unannotated-07014	The Mille-feuille dessert with caramel and ice cream was great.
en-unannotated-07015	Well mannered and attentive.
en-unannotated-07016	Loved the drinks!
en-unannotated-07017	Service was attentive, warm and friendly.
en-unannotated-07018	However, it is a 5 minute walk to the beach and is an a peaceful, quiet neighborhood.
en-unannotated-07019	I'm not sure being this secret is all that great, the place is small, 6 people sitting at the bar and 3 other people placed randomly against the back wall will fill this place to the hilt.
en-unannotated-07020	Paired with a sancerre wine and the night was off to more than a smooth start.
en-unannotated-07021	Expensive but you must go.
en-unannotated-07022	Good steaks for a decent price.
en-unannotated-07023	Amazing Pizza place which sells a large array of pizzas at 2.50 euro a slice however you can also order your own bigger ones which is nice.
en-unannotated-07024	I HAD to try the creme brûlée because I don't have it any other time beside Las Vegas buffets and it's a must here.
en-unannotated-07025	The selection of snacks on the bar looked appealing with a big focus on seafood.
en-unannotated-07026	Favourite restaurant for north city by far.
en-unannotated-07027	Cheers
en-unannotated-07028	Generally a very tired building in need of a refurbishment & better staff.
en-unannotated-07029	Dinner was excellent, with a variety of local dishes...
en-unannotated-07030	I had a complicated situation with my fiance and a business trip in between so I decided to bring her over.
en-unannotated-07031	So tender.
en-unannotated-07032	Very comfortable bed.
en-unannotated-07033	People at reception are lees friendly but correct.
en-unannotated-07034	Does what it says on the tin 😊  Added bonus, it's just 7 minute walk from Castle St.
en-unannotated-07035	It was nice but not cheap compared to other places in Moscow.
en-unannotated-07036	Easy to find on Cinco de Mayo right off the Zocalo.
en-unannotated-07037	The spaghetti was al dente and held the tomato sauce well.
en-unannotated-07038	We have no doubt that Lokal will continue to feed crowds of folks looking for a cheap way to refill their tanks before hoofing if off to the next tourist site but for us...
en-unannotated-07039	While I know and expect that service in Europe will always be slower than the states, our particular server seemed very aloof in nature and we'd have to ask for something multiple times before he finally brought it.
en-unannotated-07040	Always outstanding coffee and service
en-unannotated-07041	There are 99 beers to check off on the card and I wonder if anyone has ever had all of them checked off haha
en-unannotated-07042	Berthillon has the generally acknowledged best ice cream I’m Pais.
en-unannotated-07043	Since the new update I haven't had a single match.
en-unannotated-07044	nothing really, the service was very helpful but what they can do when the rooms are simply awful
en-unannotated-07045	Also took aeay my 25 k.
en-unannotated-07046	They serve up breakfast and lunch daily, and are open late for dinner and drinks Wednesday to Saturday.
en-unannotated-07047	Is it expensive?
en-unannotated-07048	I highly recommend.
en-unannotated-07049	We stayed at the Principale hotel in Madrid from June 2nd to June 6th.
en-unannotated-07050	Some cool features are the free food and 3 drinks at happy hour from 5:30 to 7 pm.
en-unannotated-07051	but the course were wonderful, we tasted some food which we never had in our country.
en-unannotated-07052	It worth it.
en-unannotated-07053	[NAME] and I decided to eat here on our last day on Paris and were relieved when they were able to fit us in for lunch.
en-unannotated-07054	But, still, these are the kind of potatoes worth travelling halfway across the planet for!
en-unannotated-07055	Can highly recommend the beet hummus, croquettes, fish and steak and the homemade cheese cake....
en-unannotated-07056	Very nice people at the front desk.
en-unannotated-07057	I finally made it in November with a party of six.
en-unannotated-07058	Sunday evening.
en-unannotated-07059	The guest check in experience was on par.
en-unannotated-07060	So - if you want a really nice and good czech restaurant this THE place.
en-unannotated-07061	Yes, yes, and yes.
en-unannotated-07062	Absolutely wonderful!
en-unannotated-07063	perspective.
en-unannotated-07064	The interior has kind of a strange feel, as if it was an old Irish pub at one point but got bought out by a new owner.
en-unannotated-07065	The gooseberry crumble was a great way to finish.
en-unannotated-07066	Miss Hailo so much.
en-unannotated-07067	Everything was fresh and delicious.
en-unannotated-07068	As a HUGE cider lover, I have found my place!
en-unannotated-07069	I got the French onion soup as my appetizer, peppercorn steak and fries as my entree, and finished it all with the Apple caramel dessert with Kahlua sauce.
en-unannotated-07070	This hotel has a grest location and tje employees are very corteoud.
en-unannotated-07071	I have had plenty of pasta in Many parts of Italy and it was disgusting.
en-unannotated-07072	I'd want to try the Asian salad next time which you can have it with either chicken or salmon, or the polenta cakes which don't see often on menus in Dublin.
en-unannotated-07073	Really welcoming and helpful.
en-unannotated-07074	Warm reception, situated on the third floor.
en-unannotated-07075	Place you lose.
en-unannotated-07076	Great addition to the neighbourhood!
en-unannotated-07077	Service: Very friendly and accommodating.
en-unannotated-07078	Why?
en-unannotated-07079	The service was very good and they were quick to accommodate us with whatever we needed.
en-unannotated-07080	Why iphones camera is way better in snapchat?
en-unannotated-07081	The bed felt like it had a steel rod across it.
en-unannotated-07082	The place next door is good too.
en-unannotated-07083	Got the brown sugar pancakes- AMAZINGG.
en-unannotated-07084	Carafe of house white: lovely and light, perfect for lunch.
en-unannotated-07085	There is a day menu (until 3pm) and a night menu.
en-unannotated-07086	Special thanks to [name] from the concierge for all her patience and help.
en-unannotated-07087	Not a proper catch up app.
en-unannotated-07088	Original concept with only mussels but about 10 different sauces to choose.
en-unannotated-07089	Very nice place.
en-unannotated-07090	They were unresponsive to the Yelp messenger, but we're very helpful when we called.
en-unannotated-07091	Have a drink in those condition is always good.
en-unannotated-07092	People are helpful, friendly and the place is quiet and clean.
en-unannotated-07093	The lamb was excellent, one of the best I've had in sometime.
en-unannotated-07094	The food and service are consistentlyngood , fresh and tasty.
en-unannotated-07095	No.
en-unannotated-07096	The food is divine, the waiters so nice, everything was wonderful!
en-unannotated-07097	For an appetizer we ordered the egg pate and we don't even like pate but we decided to be adventurous since that was the restaurants specialty.
en-unannotated-07098	Some people think that it's expensive compared to the likes of Starbucks or Schokoladnitsa, but cafes like those have low quality espresso, sugary lattes, appalling food and crappy service.
en-unannotated-07099	Very fresh and crisp!
en-unannotated-07100	I'd originally thought about getting a different appetizer but this would have been a huge mistake; they are known for this appetizer and hence you should get it.
en-unannotated-07101	Great value pizza that tasted incredible.
en-unannotated-07102	The place was quite crowded and since I hadn't quite figured out how to make reservations in Europe, we just walked in and were happy to get a spot by the bar.
en-unannotated-07103	I had heard of this place being the "oldest pub" in Dublin so we had to find it and stop in.
en-unannotated-07104	Bad service all in all from this renting company.
en-unannotated-07105	The perfect setting for lunch..
en-unannotated-07106	There are about 4 tables and 30 people vying for them.
en-unannotated-07107	Service was polite but fairly slow.
en-unannotated-07108	You'll buy The Farm!
en-unannotated-07109	What would be the problem that causes that?
en-unannotated-07110	You get a beer tally card that goes up to 99 once you walk in, no matter if you have a table or not.
en-unannotated-07111	The service was great, the food was great, and it was such a nice and cozy experience!
en-unannotated-07112	Old charismatic charming design.
en-unannotated-07113	Absolutely STUNNING.
en-unannotated-07114	We really enjoyed eating here.
en-unannotated-07115	Foie gras truffle ravioli was good but perhaps a little too rich.
en-unannotated-07116	Great location and staff, nice interior.
en-unannotated-07117	We knew from the first moment that this would be 'our special place' in Bogota.
en-unannotated-07118	Saffron risotto: my wife loves this, really smooth and simple.
en-unannotated-07119	There were many options to choose from at Breakfast.
en-unannotated-07120	I would stay here again mainly because of the location.
en-unannotated-07121	It really made an impression on me.
en-unannotated-07122	Delicious and filling french comfort food.
en-unannotated-07123	I have visited many times Bogota but now first time staying in this place.
en-unannotated-07124	The coffee is consistently good.
en-unannotated-07125	Walking distance to all the great things to see.
en-unannotated-07126	
en-unannotated-07127	The cosy environment and great coffee warmed me up immediately....
en-unannotated-07128	It reminded me more of an upscale sushi train with good alcohol
en-unannotated-07129	The aromas, the visual presentations, the stories, and the tastes paired with free flowing wine created...
en-unannotated-07130	I don't think this place deserves the high Yelp reviews.
en-unannotated-07131	Should be able to select multiple images though when placing an ad.
en-unannotated-07132	Nice time
en-unannotated-07133	Excellent.
en-unannotated-07134	The place has a great bistro style about it with some quirky bits included.
en-unannotated-07135	We both had tuna carpaccio as a starter and ombroise (kind of sea bass) as a main dish.
en-unannotated-07136	For mains, our favourites were the Market fish, the sword fish, apple wood smoked duck, & free range pork cutlet.
en-unannotated-07137	Yum yum yum!
en-unannotated-07138	Themed in a fantastic 1960s Milan idea, you'll enjoy old-style Milanese risotto cooked with absolute precision.
en-unannotated-07139	I wanted to be a little bit more adventurous with my choices, but I've always heard that simple dishes are often the best ones.
en-unannotated-07140	We ended up at Wyndham due to a cancellation of our flight.
en-unannotated-07141	She let me watch the entire meal preparation since we were the first seating and only pair in her restaurant at 7:45pm.
en-unannotated-07142	Despite not having made reservations prior ( still on a mission to find a place to feed the parents without getting nagged at), and having mum dressed in just a t-shirt and capris , the staff that greeted us was lovely and helpful.
en-unannotated-07143	Ask for the "concha" bread and for "chilaquiles!!
en-unannotated-07144	Excellent service oriented staff.
en-unannotated-07145	Waiter very attentive, we have a that was good.
en-unannotated-07146	The menu has quite the array of options, and would surely be enough to satisfy any palette.
en-unannotated-07147	The fit-out is industrial and sleek, and the staff display a wide knowledge of coffee and their different varieties of beans.
en-unannotated-07148	
en-unannotated-07149	The staff is super friendly and although we waited quiet a long time it was totally worth it and we got compensated with a free drink.
en-unannotated-07150	Can't recommend it highly enough!
en-unannotated-07151	Holy moly this place is so small.
en-unannotated-07152	Verve is a awesomely laid back venue that offers a wide selection of drink (there is also wine and beer - I just love the cider) and a modern Italian menu that comes out in large portions for very reasonable prices.
en-unannotated-07153	When you walk in you feel as if you are entering someones home with tables set up.
en-unannotated-07154	Great hotel super staff i often stay in this hotel and it is strategicly located in a great part of town.
en-unannotated-07155	Absolutely unclear how to give a call from he phone in the room (no any sign on it, no pen),
en-unannotated-07156	Highly recommend stopping in for lunch or a late dinner.
en-unannotated-07157	Cozy hipster atmosphere with lots of table seating that can be intimate (think first date) or accommodate the entire gang.
en-unannotated-07158	and we found exeptional food (the osso buco was surely world class!) a cosy and nicely designed interior, and a warm welcome starting with the reservation call through to the lemoncello featuring many authentic and original details.
en-unannotated-07159	Staff was very attentative to all of my request (arrived late, addtional assitance with taxis and more)
en-unannotated-07160	The brick interiors and dim lighting, along with its set up transports you into an intimate nook in the city.
en-unannotated-07161	Vine was very cheap (25euro for the most expensive) but ok....
en-unannotated-07162	For our drinks we had a flat white and an iced coffee drip.
en-unannotated-07163	Rooms haven't change since 70's !!
en-unannotated-07164	Totally love this hotel, although prices have recently gone up too much since the renovations:
en-unannotated-07165	Atmosphere: The place itself had a really fun and artistic vibe.
en-unannotated-07166	Had the full course menu for lunch.
en-unannotated-07167	However our dessert was not good.
en-unannotated-07168	Excellent courteous staff.
en-unannotated-07169	The foie ravioli was spectacular.
en-unannotated-07170	Totally worth the 20 minute line (we had no complaints as we were having Amorino gelato from down the street while we waited). I got the...
en-unannotated-07171	VERY reasonably priced.
en-unannotated-07172	They brew their own beer which is all amazing, we tried them all
en-unannotated-07173	Try their sweet potatoes chips as well (oh but remember that their kitchen closes very early)
en-unannotated-07174	If I wasn't deliberately looking for this place, I think I might of passed by it without realizing anything was there.
en-unannotated-07175	Still absolutely amazing.
en-unannotated-07176	lol No, seriously we made reservations for 6:30pm local Paris time and of course no European dines that early!
en-unannotated-07177	Would definitely recommend!
en-unannotated-07178	Other than my jet-lagged noob fail mistake of ordering red wine (btw, order a bottle of their house wine, it's amazingly delish and a fraction of the price you would get it for in America) for our entire dinner, everything was pretty much perfect.
en-unannotated-07179	They provided a basket of bread on each table.
en-unannotated-07180	Bright and light.
en-unannotated-07181	It was a hot day and I'm not use to European restaurants not having A/C but there was an electric fan and he brought it close to us.
en-unannotated-07182	As a tourist, I'm glad I came here to get a better sense of where the locals hang out.
en-unannotated-07183	My boyfriend had something else that was a bit more filling, I don't remember the name though.
en-unannotated-07184	I love the warm cozy feel of it.
en-unannotated-07185	Will be coming back again
en-unannotated-07186	At a better price.
en-unannotated-07187	We will come again.
en-unannotated-07188	A very tiny bistro that is a one woman show.
en-unannotated-07189	She gave us a brief Madrid tour by verbal.
en-unannotated-07190	Sometimes you just need to walk it off.
en-unannotated-07191	Their...
en-unannotated-07192	
en-unannotated-07193	I accidentally ordered the corned beef meal (thought it was a boxty special), and when I saw it, I was delighted--and happily gobbled up the giant portion!
en-unannotated-07194	We made a spontaneous trip to Prague and chose this restaurant to fill our stomachs and we're glad we did it.
en-unannotated-07195	Fish was fresh and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly.
en-unannotated-07196	The staff was extremely accommodating and friendly from the main desk to house-keeping.
en-unannotated-07197	We also got an order of two Italian Sausages (75 czk each / $3.86 each), which were pretty good.
en-unannotated-07198	Also the service here was 5-star for sure.
en-unannotated-07199	Soul, flavor and rock!...
en-unannotated-07200	Each bite was an adventure.
en-unannotated-07201	Android marshmallow user.
en-unannotated-07202	The hotel is very cozy and we'll maintained.
en-unannotated-07203	My burger, topped with bacon jam, onion rings, rocket and a strange mustard mayo, was quite good.
en-unannotated-07204	I would recommend making reservations ahead of time as we did a walk-in, and we were rushed to order and finish our dinner within an hour.
en-unannotated-07205	The room was like an oven.
en-unannotated-07206	I watched the lady go into the back and pull out several plastic boxes where she was assembling the gratin.
en-unannotated-07207	And I was intending to eat light...
en-unannotated-07208	I am a HUGE salt addict, especially for potatoes and their gratins needed nothing extra if they tells you anything.
en-unannotated-07209	Slightly hidden but worth the wait.
en-unannotated-07210	Had four pinxtos with two bottles of beer, all for 10 euro.
en-unannotated-07211	They wont provide you with the most gorgeus view and they dont have many seats, but they do serve great burgers in lots of different flavors.
en-unannotated-07212	I was greeted and the staff were very nice here.
en-unannotated-07213	It came with a cooked squash stuffed with beans.
en-unannotated-07214	Decent wine list.
en-unannotated-07215	The beer, as always, great and the staff was overall friendly.
en-unannotated-07216	The menu is small but by God is it delicious.
en-unannotated-07217	On arrival, the staff were friendly, welcoming and happy to explain the menu to us in English as...
en-unannotated-07218	Our party of 6 came in at around noon on a Friday; there was no wait and the staff were very friendly.
en-unannotated-07219	Funky coffee shop modern interior, across the canal from the Old Town, great coffee, breakfast & carrot cake.
en-unannotated-07220	Gratin.
en-unannotated-07221	Not far from Lubyanskaya metro station.
en-unannotated-07222	Hi,
en-unannotated-07223	It is also very cool to be staying in a 16th century building with original frescos!
en-unannotated-07224	Good internet and Rooms are quiet.
en-unannotated-07225	The Goulash was okay.
en-unannotated-07226	Order the Tortellini with cheese and apples.
en-unannotated-07227	Be sure to check it out.
en-unannotated-07228	They went out of their way to please the guests.
en-unannotated-07229	I believe that was a good way to loose audience...
en-unannotated-07230	I will be back, but I might put on my hipster novelty jumper first.
en-unannotated-07231	This is the perfect place between 'burger joint' and restaurant; great for dinner with friends, family, your mum and dad or a first date...
en-unannotated-07232	We had the al a carte menu, which was fab.
en-unannotated-07233	I was amazed of the beautiful colour and the texture...
en-unannotated-07234	(And we still managed to kiss afterwards.)
en-unannotated-07235	:-) No matter though.
en-unannotated-07236	I have pictures to put up on yelp, TripAdvisor and every social media there is.
en-unannotated-07237	Ita crap i just want to watch emmerdale and it cant even do that so bad like ughh fix it
en-unannotated-07238	Seriously good eats.
en-unannotated-07239	Also fresh, ravioli stuffed with ricotta, basil and spinach.
en-unannotated-07240	My burger was delicious!
en-unannotated-07241	Luckily we got a table .
en-unannotated-07242	Left my mouth feeling filmy from the grease.
en-unannotated-07243	The risotto was probably the most expensive entree, but it's so worth it and it actually comes in a pretty good portion.
en-unannotated-07244	Creating your own burger is fun because they have sooo many toppings and combinations to choose from that are not available elsewhere.
en-unannotated-07245	problem with an aircon, plumbing system need to be fixed...
en-unannotated-07246	It's a must try if you come here!!
en-unannotated-07247	We went there, because of the tripadvisor recommendations.
en-unannotated-07248	We would certainly recommend Madrid as a city worth visiting it has wonderful museums, great restaurants, parks etc.
en-unannotated-07249	11 euro to flog a car?
en-unannotated-07250	Had a quick visit to Bogota and so happy I picked this hotel.
en-unannotated-07251	There was a taxi strike that we didn't now about and nobody told us during the check in .
en-unannotated-07252	Amazing.
en-unannotated-07253	Excellent service provided by every single staff member of the hotel!
en-unannotated-07254	I yelped "best fish and chips" and this restaurant came up so we decided to check it out.
en-unannotated-07255	the location was ideal for the posh shops of rome
en-unannotated-07256	We came to eat lunch at Borda Berri to find it was closed inexplicably on a Sunday.
en-unannotated-07257	I had to wait only 20min to get a table for 2. Food and service were very good!
en-unannotated-07258	I would love it if you would add this feature.
en-unannotated-07259	It is a 20 minute walk from old town but we quite welcomed that to walk off the delicious food we had eaten!
en-unannotated-07260	Charming doesn't even encompass how quaint and captivating this restaurant is.
en-unannotated-07261	As the pork might not be there when you visit....
en-unannotated-07262	The breakfast its spectacular with huge variety and fresh products with excellent quality.
en-unannotated-07263	It was right by a Turibus (hop on hop off bus) stop too.
en-unannotated-07264	Perfect for a casual bite, good (smallish) outdoor space too 😀
en-unannotated-07265	Great service, excellent breakfast buffet with lots of food and fresh made juices.
en-unannotated-07266	The pie was actually quite nice & the view was good but I wouldn't go here again.
en-unannotated-07267	The food arrived quick & hot and were packed full of flavors, we were all blown away!
en-unannotated-07268	like 20 people MAX in this place and that would be very tight.
en-unannotated-07269	Definitely highlight to our trip!
en-unannotated-07270	Highly recommended...
en-unannotated-07271	Charming old world clubby feel
en-unannotated-07272	Our waiter had to be the best waiter we had in Prague.
en-unannotated-07273	Food ordinary for the price, We were a table of 6 people.
en-unannotated-07274	We wanted to try something different, so we ordered the savory pancakes.
en-unannotated-07275	I booked at the Atton 100 by mistake thinking it was the Atton 93. That error forced me to walk 25 minutes daily from the hotel to Parque de la 93 and back.
en-unannotated-07276	It will say that I haven't see it.
en-unannotated-07277	The menu is not extensive but perfectly designed for what's on offer.
en-unannotated-07278	The room itself is very clean and most of the front desk staff are nice and helpful.
en-unannotated-07279	One of the best alcoholic ginger beers I've ever had was here.
en-unannotated-07280	Perfect food from a very selected menu, very friendly staff, beautiful location!
en-unannotated-07281	It was lively, but not overcrowded, warm and cozy and I feel like whoever created the playlist needs to be my new best friend- great music!
en-unannotated-07282	Nothing is more intriguing to me than how the French make their pates, and use parts of the animal that aren't as popular in the states.
en-unannotated-07283	Location.
en-unannotated-07284	We do not want to reveal the room number in case it is never available for us again!
en-unannotated-07285	Menu is varied and full of surprises, dishes are good looking and yet delicious.
en-unannotated-07286	The prices are expensive but this is one of those places where the food quality is worth the premium price.
en-unannotated-07287	it was amazing.
en-unannotated-07288	I always crave savory breakfast items, and these savory pancakes are the answers to your prayers.
en-unannotated-07289	Please take good care of the place for me:-)
en-unannotated-07290	nice bar.
en-unannotated-07291	While this is a cute spot with good service, the food quality and environment felt too much like a cafeteria.
en-unannotated-07292	Its Lagging so much and In Game things are not looking good as well...
en-unannotated-07293	Then they charged 2% on any card even if you said to put it on savings!!!
en-unannotated-07294	My guests ordered fish from their fresh catch menu.
en-unannotated-07295	The menu is written on a board, so I assume it changes regularly.
en-unannotated-07296	my my wife enjoyed the slice of cake she ordered.
en-unannotated-07297	I have stayed here for a long time.
en-unannotated-07298	Restaurant gets VERY busy and often noisy get there early to avoid the crowds and make a booking.
en-unannotated-07299	The Boxty House also has an early bird menu that includes 2 courses for about 20 euro (goes until 6:30pm I think?).
en-unannotated-07300	The rooms were large and clean, great for small children.
en-unannotated-07301	Will...
en-unannotated-07302	The server said that the veal kidneys were a very typical French dish, but that it had a strong flavor, and warned that I may not like it.
en-unannotated-07303	Hotel looks very smart & couldn't really fault anything as only here for overnight stay.
en-unannotated-07304	If you need to have a last meal before flying out of Milan, definitely go here.
en-unannotated-07305	We really enjoyed staying there.
en-unannotated-07306	Service was excellent very friendly guys, charming and helpful.
en-unannotated-07307	We went there during a sailing trip.
en-unannotated-07308	All dishes were fantastic and the service is exceptional.
en-unannotated-07309	Old fashioned 60's as its best.
en-unannotated-07310	Our meals didn't take too long to arrive and my meal was a work of art.
en-unannotated-07311	We waited for 40 minutes to get a table and it was not worth it.
en-unannotated-07312	[name] on the front desk was lovely and couldn't have been more helpful.
en-unannotated-07313	5 stars.
en-unannotated-07314	Bartenders were friendly and attentive.
en-unannotated-07315	Menu is limited but we were there really for a pre-dinner drink.
en-unannotated-07316	A win.
en-unannotated-07317	Overall the service was genuine and you could tell they all worked hard.
en-unannotated-07318	I've stayed here four times in the past month and half and have always been please.
en-unannotated-07319	Some dried tomatoes in aioli.
en-unannotated-07320	Attentive staff & pleasant modern interior.
en-unannotated-07321	Despite being so...
en-unannotated-07322	We're so glad we stuck around.
en-unannotated-07323	Great and real mexican food, especially famous pozole, with various options to choose.
en-unannotated-07324	We wanted to try authentic Czech food, and this restaurant was highly-rated on Yelp.
en-unannotated-07325	The slow cooked oyster blade was the chosen one tonight and it married well with their Shiraz by the glass.
en-unannotated-07326	The room was very big and comfortable, the amenities were great and the breakfast was delicious.
en-unannotated-07327	Gratin was delicious.
en-unannotated-07328	Nice terrace upstairs but limited choice.
en-unannotated-07329	I loved the shrimp tacos- delicious.
en-unannotated-07330	While the old "mill farmer" ambiance is similar, the Žatecká restaurant is larger which means the tables are more spaced apart.
en-unannotated-07331	Assisted at the complaint of a customer quite unpleasant
en-unannotated-07332	It's great!
en-unannotated-07333	At the end we were rudely informed service charge is not included on the bill.
en-unannotated-07334	Loly explained her passion and her love and appreciation for Mother Earth....
en-unannotated-07335	The hotel is in an excellent location, with a shopping and restaurant district nearby.
en-unannotated-07336	First was a salad with some rounds of French goat cheese was just superb (Chèvre chaud). The cheese quality was unreal, it was heaven on a plate.
en-unannotated-07337	I also like the variety of different patterns thay have for the snake/worm.
en-unannotated-07338	Let's put it this way...
en-unannotated-07339	Just wonderful people to interact with.
en-unannotated-07340	If you dislike hipsters & deconstructed food, don't go here.
en-unannotated-07341	Check.
en-unannotated-07342	Extremely clean accommodations and beautiful facility, excellent food and atmosphere, the best JW we have ever stayed in.
en-unannotated-07343	Onion soup was not bad, melted cheese float over the soup as well as bread.
en-unannotated-07344	From making the reservation to arrival to departure and of course everything in between !
en-unannotated-07345	There was no fois gras on the dinner menu - we had a tartine of duck and a cucumber salad to begin - the duck was very tasty and the salad was good.
en-unannotated-07346	Continental breakfast with best choices on this 2 week tour of UK, Italy, and Spain.
en-unannotated-07347	But options were less.
en-unannotated-07348	We can highly recommend this Italian restaurant.
en-unannotated-07349	If you do you might miss out on a unfancy and juicy burger to a decent price.
en-unannotated-07350	So good!
en-unannotated-07351	From the waitress to the kitchen staff, everyone was unpleasant and impatient.
en-unannotated-07352	Waiters are quick, helpful, and genuinely care about your enjoyment of the meal.
en-unannotated-07353	Put a bad ending on our meal.
en-unannotated-07354	I ate here as part of pigs back deal.
en-unannotated-07355	5
en-unannotated-07356	And ordered the same thing!
en-unannotated-07357	Stopped by for lunch for the first time.
en-unannotated-07358	Had probably one of the best meals in my life here and definitely the best meal in Paris.
en-unannotated-07359	Loved the apartment size ,design, cleanliness and elegance .
en-unannotated-07360	The presentation was tear evoking.
en-unannotated-07361	After touring Trinity College we stopped in for some lunch and we're so happy that we did.
en-unannotated-07362	I mean how many people can say they went...
en-unannotated-07363	It had a great vibe, good people, wine and tapas, and appeared to also be popular among the locals.
en-unannotated-07364	The wait staff were excellent.
en-unannotated-07365	One half was deep fried with an asian salad of cucumber, carrot and asian dressing.
en-unannotated-07366	We had the traditional menu and it was wonderful.
en-unannotated-07367	You'll be glad you did!
en-unannotated-07368	Once in a lifetime experience in this underground wine cellar turned restaurant!
en-unannotated-07369	The beds are lovely and comfy, rooms have everything you need and it's all housed in a stunning old building with many original features retained in the public spaces.
en-unannotated-07370	We couldn't leave without trying the desserts and obviously we were in Italia so I wouldn't go back without trying the Tiramisu.
en-unannotated-07371	For dessert, I had the cheesecake.
en-unannotated-07372	Great Italian food at the square.
en-unannotated-07373	This was a huge bummer, but the chefs agreed to make me something vegetarian.
en-unannotated-07374	Everything was so delicious, especially the duck.
en-unannotated-07375	Nothing came close to this.
en-unannotated-07376	Overall its a good game.
en-unannotated-07377	The staff went out of their way to help us.
en-unannotated-07378	We will definitely come back!
en-unannotated-07379	There was already a line of locals (great sign!) waiting to buy meat (since it doubles as a butcher shop). There's a separate line for a la carte food ordering and it moves rather quickly.
en-unannotated-07380	I would HIGHLY recommend it
en-unannotated-07381	Situated just a street away from the seafront, perfect for strolling along the promenade to the centre which was just a 5 to 10 minutes walk.
en-unannotated-07382	Crab and snapper risotto was amazing but a little rich for my taste buds but can't fault it.
en-unannotated-07383	The servings were perfectly portioned as well .
en-unannotated-07384	I didn't want to be disappointed in local French cuisine so I was SUPER careful about which bistro to dine at.
en-unannotated-07385	The waiters/bartenders made us feel very welcome in the restaurant even though we got there a bit early so the kitchen wasn't open yet (kitchen opens around 19h30 I believe); there were several other people at the restaurant having drinks and sitting and chatting among friends while waiting for the kitchen to open.
en-unannotated-07386	If you are visiting I would say lunch is a must because it is such a screaming bargain, and dinner is a must if you want a very nice, well priced, enjoyable meal.
en-unannotated-07387	Everything was excellent, everything was devoured.
en-unannotated-07388	After staring at the menu above the counter for a long enough time to get a sore neck (FYI they have grab-able menus - I just didn't realise), I eventually ended up building my own concoction of a Beef Pattie with grilled capsicum, grilled pumpkin, iceberg and caramelised onion jam with no cheese and tzatziki sauce ($11). Having had a massive breakfast I decided to forego the bun, which they'll happily do.
en-unannotated-07389	Price is between 250-350 ruble.
en-unannotated-07390	The staff were very hospitable, they always had time to answer questions and tried their best to understand or strange requests in English.
en-unannotated-07391	I only wished that they had toasted the bun a little longer, as it was kind of lukewarm when I got it.
en-unannotated-07392	two hours went by, but our food never showed up.
en-unannotated-07393	Friendly barista's, great tasting coffee and different environment being amongst the hustle of the market made for a worthwhile visit.
en-unannotated-07394	Drury is not a luxury brand but the rooms are clean and spacious, the beds are comfortable and the shower head is great.
en-unannotated-07395	The "limoncello" at the end of the meal not only was unexpected but it was delicious.
en-unannotated-07396	This seems to be the norm though in Paris
en-unannotated-07397	It is a perfect spot to celebrate a special evening or host some visitors who have an appreciation for fine dining, seafood and will enjoy a stunning view of the river and story bridge while you dine.
en-unannotated-07398	Definitely glad we took a walk up the street this little restaurant was on.
en-unannotated-07399	Presentation was also pretty cool with grilled peaches and crushed sugar crusted violet flowers on the side....
en-unannotated-07400	Some of the communal areas also had threadbare furniture.
en-unannotated-07401	They also have nice lunch specials on the menu daily.
en-unannotated-07402	The pork knuckle is awesome!
en-unannotated-07403	The fried chicken was crispy, juicy, and less greasy than typical American fried chicken, and it paired perfectly with their homemade sauce, pickles, lettuce, and tomato.
en-unannotated-07404	Highly recommended!
en-unannotated-07405	Rounded by a glass of Malbec.
en-unannotated-07406	Just a short distance from our hostel it was a place to definitely visit.
en-unannotated-07407	The burger was so good we came back.
en-unannotated-07408	Words cannot describe how good Den Noc is!
en-unannotated-07409	What a wonderful meal to start off a memorable October weekend in Prague!
en-unannotated-07410	While my android camera waay better than the iphone's and still like you're taking a screen shot of my camera..
en-unannotated-07411	Very friendly and detail-oriented staff.
en-unannotated-07412	The Chef has a great handle on...
en-unannotated-07413	We stayed at Leku Eder for 2 nights during our San Sebastian portion of a tour of Spain.
en-unannotated-07414	So, if you in Moscow you should visit this cafe.
en-unannotated-07415	More than enough for two, we even shared with the gentleman sitting solo next to us.
en-unannotated-07416	It was the duck associated dishes!!
en-unannotated-07417	Plus the location really is perfect!
en-unannotated-07418	It's worth the trip to Madrid!
en-unannotated-07419	it could not have been a better experience!!!
en-unannotated-07420	I enjoyed the gym for the size and the equipment and the fact it has a decent size pool.
en-unannotated-07421	And above all the food was excellent - everything we had was very good with very reasonable prices.
en-unannotated-07422	Great small and cozy restaurant outside of "downtown" area.
en-unannotated-07423	This restaurant had a beautiful setting and very friendly staff.
en-unannotated-07424	This place has a delicious variety of fish and shrimp tacos, at a very accesible price!
en-unannotated-07425	They were both delicious.
en-unannotated-07426	This hotel was a fantastic surprise-luxurious, private, clean with excellent guest service.
en-unannotated-07427	Super, smal place really nice, nice atmosphere, quite some locals also wich is a good sighn, very cheap and great food.
en-unannotated-07428	Came here during french election night.
en-unannotated-07429	Excellent central position
en-unannotated-07430	Went for dinner but the staff were so rude in the end we walked away.
en-unannotated-07431	If you are going to spend saturday in Mexico City and don't know what to do, let me recommend going to San Angel.
en-unannotated-07432	Order the Pork and also the comillo con foi!!
en-unannotated-07433	of our 9th year anniversary in Rome sucked!!!
en-unannotated-07434	I highly recommend!
en-unannotated-07435	A bit os basic homework to be done by the staff, but they are ambitious so  I am sure they will get things right in the end.
en-unannotated-07436	My husband and I loved this place - incredible food and the hot chocolate was divine!
en-unannotated-07437	We didn't have a reservation...
en-unannotated-07438	The dish came to my table literally bubbling.
en-unannotated-07439	We went to this restaurant last night based on the Michelin recommendation.
en-unannotated-07440	- The welcome item is a grim miniature 'Pringles' chips tub for 2;
en-unannotated-07441	the bed was not soft it was uncomfortable it should have been very soft and very good quality like in most other 5 star hotels
en-unannotated-07442	I went mid afternoon so there was not a crowd at all but when returning in the evening it was very crowded.
en-unannotated-07443	Very tasty indeed and a pretty healthy portion for only €12. Other items also looked tempting too, but I was solo, so now I have to go back to try some more dishes.
en-unannotated-07444	the best one to see sunset.
en-unannotated-07445	Had dinner at the hotel restaurant and it was both expensive and not up to standards in terms of good food.
en-unannotated-07446	The external walls are glass which allows diners to have a great view of the Story Bridge.
en-unannotated-07447	Catch bus 13 to get to the centre (3.40€ for 2 people) - you can get tickets on the bus.
en-unannotated-07448	I ordered the Morton Bay Bugs, biggest I've seen, very juicy too.
en-unannotated-07449	Beautiful hotel.
en-unannotated-07450	In terms of service, standards are different from what I generally experience in U.S. restaurants but this was among the best we had at European restaurants on our trip.
en-unannotated-07451	Came here yesterday on a friend's recommendation and now I can't wait to tell everyone about this place!
en-unannotated-07452	We settled on tiramisu which expertly was delicious.
en-unannotated-07453	Outstanding.
en-unannotated-07454	This is the cutest little restaurant!
en-unannotated-07455	It takes me well over 30 mins to get through one spin now.
en-unannotated-07456	We had our wedding anniversary on the deck on a Saturday afternoon in early September with 40 guests.
en-unannotated-07457	This place gets backed so you should really plan ahead and make a reservation early.
en-unannotated-07458	It is also near a souvenir shopping strip and a famous church.
en-unannotated-07459	If you don't mind leaving the tourist havens and taking an uber or the metro out here, definitely put this on your list of must-try restaurants.
en-unannotated-07460	Excellent place to check the beer goulash.
en-unannotated-07461	Our homeboy Dominique hooked it up with limoncello, meloncello, and pistachello as dessert and Damn Fam!
en-unannotated-07462	The tortilla and chicken itself were nice though, and the cheese all over it.
en-unannotated-07463	My twin sister and I go away on holiday together every year for a weekend in Europe.
en-unannotated-07464	The most delicious part of the entree was the peas influenced with bacon (seriously best thing!!
en-unannotated-07465	Naturally, when in Paris, I wanted to try the best of Parisian fare ranging from gutter crepes to the very high end.
en-unannotated-07466	It's not my first stay with this hotel.
en-unannotated-07467	My husband and I recently celebrated our wedding anniversary in Mexico City.
en-unannotated-07468	I thought [NAME] couldn't be in Dublin eating at this restaurant, but as I went in the servers were buzzing about it.
en-unannotated-07469	Even taxi drivers hate using it
en-unannotated-07470	You are surrounded by all kind of places to eat, drink or get partying.
en-unannotated-07471	We checked in too late and could not leave the property at that time.
en-unannotated-07472	Excellent service.
en-unannotated-07473	I can't write a review great enough.
en-unannotated-07474	As I worked my way over to Rue Mouffetard, I came across this darling little bistro.
en-unannotated-07475	The food - I had the cerviche for appetizer , which was not that great - a few chunks of the fish did not taste too fresh ...
en-unannotated-07476	So far this had been an amazing app.
en-unannotated-07477	-Friendly staff
en-unannotated-07478	The ribs and the duck are very tasteful.
en-unannotated-07479	I'd describe it as a boutique small and cute place.
en-unannotated-07480	It's not 5 star at all
en-unannotated-07481	We had a beautiful room overlooking the river.
en-unannotated-07482	The soup stock was liquid gold and my only complaint was that I wanted more vermicelli noodles.
en-unannotated-07483	First i thought my phone has got some fault i thought it needs checking.
en-unannotated-07484	It's not a place to come on your own for a lunch break though.
en-unannotated-07485	The duck breast was the winner of both dishes and the honey cumin sauce was quite interesting.
en-unannotated-07486	This is by far the smallest restaurant we have ever eaten in.
en-unannotated-07487	Smoking smell in non smoking room
en-unannotated-07488	The staff was lovely and communicated with us easily in English (our French is ummm...
en-unannotated-07489	Excellent fine dining experience with touches of Brisbane casual but no sloppiness.
en-unannotated-07490	My opponent in some games does not take a shot in time but the game freezes and again I lose.
en-unannotated-07491	You can go the ready designed ones which are still made fresh.
en-unannotated-07492	It is well worth the wait.
en-unannotated-07493	Chicago Prime, for instance.
en-unannotated-07494	Italian food that you really really want to eat after traveling all over Italy.
en-unannotated-07495	Cold room since there is no central heating.
en-unannotated-07496	Brazen Head has a few problems as well; most noticeably - they need more room.
en-unannotated-07497	Den Noc is definitely a super solid cafe, with some super solid pancakes.
en-unannotated-07498	Loly...
en-unannotated-07499	Really buggy app.
en-unannotated-07500	They offer a wine pairing at a fair price but the wines were not impressive....
en-unannotated-07501	Beautiful setting, but a great disappointment.
en-unannotated-07502	Spacious appartment, excellent location.
en-unannotated-07503	Absolute gem of a place.
en-unannotated-07504	The waiter was so nice as well!
en-unannotated-07505	I'll give it a go though: sashimi tacos - an old fave, fresh and spicy; sweet and succulent barbecue corn; panko rice and edamame balls - just the right amount of wasabi heat.
en-unannotated-07506	Good breakfast and professional staff
en-unannotated-07507	There was a lot of rustic charm, but the beds and mattresses definitely need an upgrade.
en-unannotated-07508	If you want to enjoy an evening along with a good meal - look for something else.
en-unannotated-07509	I'm absolutely not condemning this restaurant for that, as I believe it is a huge part of what makes this restaurant as cozy and comforting as it is.
en-unannotated-07510	Rooms comfortable and functional.
en-unannotated-07511	We also came home to a note on our door the first day warning us to respect the 9-9 quiet hours or the police would be called.
en-unannotated-07512	I would definitely go again.
en-unannotated-07513	To die for....
en-unannotated-07514	It's always stuck at 501 songs and when i add a new one it deletes the last song added.
en-unannotated-07515	The hot chocolate is unbeatable, it has the most intense chocolate flavour.
en-unannotated-07516	Great location and comfortable unit to relax in after a busy day.
en-unannotated-07517	The room was very small.
en-unannotated-07518	Sexy as the surroundings were, the food was hit and miss.
en-unannotated-07519	Stuff were super friendly and excellent.
en-unannotated-07520	My wife and I had the taster menu with caviar and it was out of this world.
en-unannotated-07521	We enjoyed good dinner of homemade noodles with sea urchin eggs and borscht to start, followed by cod with Kamchatka crab (my dining companion and I both chose the same main dish). When ordering the main course we enquired whether the crab was already prepared...
en-unannotated-07522	Unfortunately we were disappointed.
en-unannotated-07523	Enthusiastic servers and vibrant feel.
en-unannotated-07524	staff was extremely helpful and accommodating
en-unannotated-07525	They just took a break to clean tables and chat without cooking anything- I can see it cause the kitchen is right next to us.
en-unannotated-07526	We had a crab salad appetizer, sea bass prepared with crispy skin, vegetables, and a lovely citrus cream sauce, the pig cheek and quinoa, lentils and corriander with a wine reduction was absolutely succulent.
en-unannotated-07527	Nice location with walking distance to all main attractions of old Rome.
en-unannotated-07528	Although you are in the middle of the touristy part of town, they don't carry touristy prices and do carry phenomenal food.
en-unannotated-07529	They don't rush you, and truly enjoy creating food.
en-unannotated-07530	Nothing
en-unannotated-07531	It is on the pricer side, but highly recommended!
en-unannotated-07532	The first visit we both had the chicken pesto sandwich, and although I'm never a fan of gluten free (I'm not coeliac), I was a big fan of this...
en-unannotated-07533	Expect great service great quality ingredients and awesome deserts.
en-unannotated-07534	Will be back for the goulash!
en-unannotated-07535	Excellent meat, but service a bit slow.
en-unannotated-07536	The food was delightful and the service was spot on.
en-unannotated-07537	This hotel has a great location, a beautiful view of the city, and is clean and well attended.
en-unannotated-07538	Never would expect to have such an impression from a salad.
en-unannotated-07539	I will be coming back to Jellyfish in the near future!
en-unannotated-07540	Highly recommend the hotel !!!
en-unannotated-07541	The server was really nice after I asked if she spoke English.
en-unannotated-07542	Get there early or you will not get a table.
en-unannotated-07543	The restaurant was pretty crowded almost immediately after opening and you probably will sit next to strangers.
en-unannotated-07544	The atmosphere was great we will return
en-unannotated-07545	Love this establishment.
en-unannotated-07546	I was forced to upgrade at the rate of  70euros/night to get a room that was big enough for my 2 suitcases, overcharged for the in room bar.
en-unannotated-07547	We were chosen as "clients of the day", so we received a room with a luminous terrace and plenty of little details (fruit, coffee, etc.)
en-unannotated-07548	Quiet, excelent service and food!
en-unannotated-07549	Everyone was kind and accommodating.
en-unannotated-07550	Parking and breakfast was really expensive.
en-unannotated-07551	Terrible disappointing App.
en-unannotated-07552	She was on-point.
en-unannotated-07553	Staff are excellent
en-unannotated-07554	-Their restrooms are nice and clean
en-unannotated-07555	Too crowded.
en-unannotated-07556	It is hard to write a comment about something that I had been waiting for so long and I was so excited about(I was literally very nervous when ringing the bell). Thus I decided to keep all my feelings to myself :) I just want...
en-unannotated-07557	If you try to keep your workplace info off of here, good luck.
en-unannotated-07558	All that for a reasonable price in Dublin.
en-unannotated-07559	However.....
en-unannotated-07560	Another good sign is the long waiting list of folks trying get a table for dinner after 9.45 pm on a Sunday night.
en-unannotated-07561	Wish I could give you more stars but five is the top!!!
en-unannotated-07562	I also ordered a side dish salad: some chopped fresh tomatoes, cucumber, mais and slaw.
en-unannotated-07563	at Lokal...
en-unannotated-07564	Would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Madrid.
en-unannotated-07565	Come to Sake expecting perfectly prepared Sushi and an ample selection of share plates to choose from.
en-unannotated-07566	Definitely a great place to go in Prague - fairly close to the old town square and yummy pancakes in a cute and cozy cafe.
en-unannotated-07567	The patty was cooked perfectly medium rare and juicy and the flavour worked well with the grilled vegies and onion jam.
en-unannotated-07568	Amazing crepes that left us speechless!
en-unannotated-07569	Had a minor issue with equipment in room and staff had it resolved within minutes.
en-unannotated-07570	This is my third visit to the place and needless to say I'm already planning the fourth!
en-unannotated-07571	The duck salad was standout.
en-unannotated-07572	It's one of those places where what you are looking for is right there, on one spot.
en-unannotated-07573	Yay!
en-unannotated-07574	Concierge was excellent.
en-unannotated-07575	I was surprised that most were almost 7 Euro and a Raging Bitch was damn near 9! I guess we're just spoiled by living less than an hour away from Flying Dog back home, but golly!
en-unannotated-07576	It all feels like you've just discovered a secret society & become a member of some very suave club.
en-unannotated-07577	The decor is gorgeous and they have jars full of candy to snack on while you're waiting.
en-unannotated-07578	Brisbane festival 2014 & Riverfire can't come soon enough!
en-unannotated-07579	Its minimalist elegance, discreet serenity, extraordinary staff and restaurant services surpass those of many hotels in Europe that charge twice the price.
en-unannotated-07580	Helpful staff, English at the counter.
en-unannotated-07581	We shared a basket of onion rings to start off with.
en-unannotated-07582	Terrible estimates, it always says there's a car a minute away but takes me more than 10 to get a cab.
en-unannotated-07583	Great soft music and amazing wine...
en-unannotated-07584	It used to be the old Qld Rugby Club site but has been transformed into a beautiful space with inspiration from the excesses of the 20's & "Gatsby" era.
en-unannotated-07585	No, it wasn't just the liquor talking.
en-unannotated-07586	No nonsense Alfredo, alla vodka or all that American shit.
en-unannotated-07587	Including foodie friends who tell me they don't like burgers!!
en-unannotated-07588	Polite staff, great location and ok prices, especially taken into consideration that it is Moscow.
en-unannotated-07589	Food at the restaurants was very good ( a bit expensive but you have to expect it at a hotel like that)
en-unannotated-07590	Convenient hotel for my business trip to Madrid in May/June 2017. Hope to come back sometime in the near future and woul recommend this hotel to all People I know going to Madrid for business or Leisure.
en-unannotated-07591	Excellent service, the people here are the sweetest people imaginable.
en-unannotated-07592	City break to Madrid for 4 nights meant we had a lot of pack in to a short time.
en-unannotated-07593	Don't hold back; wear your cocktail dress, grab a stunning drink and order a fancy meal.
en-unannotated-07594	We were looking for some comfort food.
en-unannotated-07595	Many more problems are happening...
en-unannotated-07596	Just arrived in Brisbane and had several locals recommend the Brew Cafe.
en-unannotated-07597	It's a must go if you visit Bogotá. They have a really good beer, the staff is really kind and the chef makes sure that you enjoy your visit.
en-unannotated-07598	Just had lunch at Verve, and after not being here for a few years, my opinion has not changed at all, they still are amazing.
en-unannotated-07599	Bath no plug and no shower curtain with obvious consequences.
en-unannotated-07600	It's basically pesto and you won't taste any other part of the burger.
en-unannotated-07601	The waitress that night also spoke excellent English, if you don't speak French.
en-unannotated-07602	I liked the low key, dim lighting atmosphere; perfect for a date night and dinner with a few friends.
en-unannotated-07603	The room was a standard double, facing out onto the garden to the rear of the hotel and was spacious and comfortable.
en-unannotated-07604	I think I would've enjoyed it more if I got a different flavor though.
en-unannotated-07605	The sandwich Corse complet has 3 Michelin stars : worth the visit!
en-unannotated-07606	He also took some time to...
en-unannotated-07607	It is set in the Communist Pub style- wood tables in a big hall with no decor but the food and beer make up for it!
en-unannotated-07608	That way there is room in your wallet for drinks and dessert as well-total cost of a meal shouldnt be more than $12 per person including everything.
en-unannotated-07609	Great value for money
en-unannotated-07610	Great atmosphere and our waiter had a great attitude.
en-unannotated-07611	We brought our own cake so no one actually saw the dessert menu so I can't comment there.
en-unannotated-07612	Excellent place to stay for business or pleasure.
en-unannotated-07613	Staff was friendly.
en-unannotated-07614	The dressing was light yet flavorful and complemented all the duck parts so well.
en-unannotated-07615	If your looking for an ok price and willing to sleep in an a not very clean hotel with the best location.
en-unannotated-07616	I ate in two places in Milan, and have ate in plenty of Italian restaurant in Los Angeles.
en-unannotated-07617	We initially planned to eat macarons at the mainstream locations but we were super lucky to stumble across this beautiful place!
en-unannotated-07618	Breakfast is included and contains a wide variety of items to satisfy anyone.
en-unannotated-07619	I also like the bit where you have the opportunity to sell stuff.
en-unannotated-07620	Evreytime I go to find new people it says "something went wrong please try again later". My internet connection is strong so I don't really understand why it always does this???
en-unannotated-07621	Cann't sleep for whole night.
en-unannotated-07622	The restaurant is very small and cozy, and exactly what I was looking for, for a unique experience.
en-unannotated-07623	No one showed up
en-unannotated-07624	We will definitely be returning on our next visit to Paris
en-unannotated-07625	The oysters are more than lovely.
en-unannotated-07626	We had Boniffacio and carbonara both excellent and we all enjoyed including our 2 yr old
en-unannotated-07627	Excellent newer Residence Inn...
en-unannotated-07628	I'd be more than happy to revise this review and give it one more star if I see that the quality of the cooking improves in the future, but for now that dinner did not hold up to the standards of Milano at all.
en-unannotated-07629	The beer battered fries were amazing!
en-unannotated-07630	The interior is absolutely stunning - very much like dining in a Baroque palace.
en-unannotated-07631	We apparently got there right when it opened, the kitchen wasn't even open yet.
en-unannotated-07632	Came here for my birthday dinner while in Dublin and loved it!
en-unannotated-07633	The staff was friendly and helpful throughout the hotel, always willing to assist.
en-unannotated-07634	All good.
en-unannotated-07635	But we didn't like the noodles ...
en-unannotated-07636	Both...
en-unannotated-07637	After our meal our waitress suggested the house tiramisu in a tazza (small cup/jar) if you love desserts get one just for you!!!
en-unannotated-07638	A must for anyone staying more than a few days.
en-unannotated-07639	The team have all trained at Le cordon Bleu worked at the...
en-unannotated-07640	You end up with a truly unique burger (for ex: you could get a beef burger w/grilled pumpkin, onion jam, jalapenos, cheddar cheese and red capsicum relish) that only you may have invented (pretty cool!!).
en-unannotated-07641	I frequent this restaurant a couple of times of month, but not until today had a felt comfortable writing a review.
en-unannotated-07642	Priced reasonably.
en-unannotated-07643	Tasteless food.
en-unannotated-07644	What a great place to bring a favorite wine (or buy one next door?) and relax for the evening.
en-unannotated-07645	The place is nicely decorated, service is good, and the atmosphere is nice.
en-unannotated-07646	I then had the cottage pie, which is their divine take on shepherd's pie & some random vegetables.
en-unannotated-07647	Breakfast buffet was very good.
en-unannotated-07648	You can't go wrong here since the meat is so fresh and there always seems to be a line.
en-unannotated-07649	Different guests may have different feeling, but all of my colleagues felt that somehow reviews do not fairly represent the real feature of this hotel.
en-unannotated-07650	For the amount of food you get, the price is reasonable.
en-unannotated-07651	Impressive hospitality and welcome.
en-unannotated-07652	Other than that it useful.
en-unannotated-07653	All of the courses being delicious!
en-unannotated-07654	An exercise in how not to migrate to a new system.
en-unannotated-07655	Let's just get it over with and rename this joint The Swanky Co.
en-unannotated-07656	With the few choices left, I chose Epicure at le Bristol.
en-unannotated-07657	I found this place via yelp so thought I'd contribute to it's fan-base :) What a great little gem in the Montmatre area of Paris.
en-unannotated-07658	...i'm constantly failing...
en-unannotated-07659	The price is very reasonable.
en-unannotated-07660	Update after 20 min: they gave me the wrong order so I had to cancel and leave cause I didn't wanna wait another 20 min.
en-unannotated-07661	We obviously decided to skip the appetizers and go for the pasta.
en-unannotated-07662	The rooms are just great: excelent beds, great decor, very comfortable.
en-unannotated-07663	I had the skirt steak and my associate had the lamb chops.
en-unannotated-07664	Perfect location at what appears to be a hotel row.
en-unannotated-07665	She was very kind and her suggestions were great!
en-unannotated-07666	We had a wonderful lunch here today with our family of 4 (two children). The crepes were delicious and my husband and daughter each had a burger with fries.
en-unannotated-07667	Bed very comfortable, but a trifle "sweaty". Staff excellent.
en-unannotated-07668	You can get white brown or black rice or even quinoa and kale as the base.
en-unannotated-07669	They have a great selection of ciders, I didn't try any but my friends enjoyed theirs!
en-unannotated-07670	She likes simple recipe's that don't over do the taste of the ingredients.
en-unannotated-07671	Friendliness and attention of the staff, the location
en-unannotated-07672	The pork chop was huge with small potatoes and gravy.
en-unannotated-07673	We decided to stay at this Holiday Inn for our zoo trip.
en-unannotated-07674	Touting as modern European, The Survey Co hosts a creative and adventurous menu.
en-unannotated-07675	If it isn't Australian, they're not serving it.
en-unannotated-07676	Knocked it down a star because we were confused about seating, menus, and ordering (all of which we did ourselves no server). Thanks for a great evening!
en-unannotated-07677	Snapchat when ever I look at someone's story and then reopen the app.
en-unannotated-07678	I arrived late and was warmly greeted by the staff.
en-unannotated-07679	Chilaquiles and sabana .
en-unannotated-07680	Tuna ceviche amazing as well as the salmon with honey and sesame seeds.
en-unannotated-07681	Great location and super friendly staff.
en-unannotated-07682	The one with the citrus sauce...
en-unannotated-07683	Unfortunately, the evening we stayed at this property a drunk driver hit an electric box, knocking out power to a complete city block at 12:30am.
en-unannotated-07684	I am not by ANY means an adventurous Japanese cuisine devourer.
en-unannotated-07685	The hotel is fairly new, with clean rooms and modern amenities.
en-unannotated-07686	LAST TIP?
en-unannotated-07687	I lived for 13 years in Italy and can really say what's a real Italian pizza or not.
en-unannotated-07688	That was a wenesday or something like this.
en-unannotated-07689	The app was great when I first got it.
en-unannotated-07690	The store was beautiful .
en-unannotated-07691	Nothing
en-unannotated-07692	For a restaurant within this price bracket in Mexico, you would expect a flawless dining experience (high prices were not a surprise, service level was most certainly a big disappointment). I love steaks and I've had specially good experiences in other Capital Grille locations, but...
en-unannotated-07693	I ate alone, and you do not feel weird eating here alone in case you are a solo traveler.
en-unannotated-07694	We started with foie gras, had the steak and finished with a tart for dessert.
en-unannotated-07695	Don't hesitate.
en-unannotated-07696	Other restaurants and tapas bars were just a few minutes away.
en-unannotated-07697	After a while the levels just get stupid.
en-unannotated-07698	This hotel was very, very nice.
en-unannotated-07699	Clean and new!!
en-unannotated-07700	For an entree, I ordered the duck with the house sauce, I got a fig sauce when I visited.
en-unannotated-07701	The spicy beef sausage was also solid and it comes with some bread so it's really a full meal.
en-unannotated-07702	Great place for coffee and a chat if you need a quiet place that's out of the way.
en-unannotated-07703	The cappuccino , was very delicious .
en-unannotated-07704	Food was 4* on taste.
en-unannotated-07705	Packed with antiques but with very, very good food and nice servise, pleasant and good waiters it is simply place you must visit while in Moscow.
en-unannotated-07706	The price is really good for what you receive.
en-unannotated-07707	I got the duck with bananas for dinner, which was out of this world delicious!
en-unannotated-07708	Telephon was damaged and switched off, in the room was very very cold ( Even with turned on heating).
en-unannotated-07709	Not very clean (dust and hair balls under beds),needs a refresh.
en-unannotated-07710	The staff were so professional and helpful.
en-unannotated-07711	Be sure to get a reservation as they get full quickly.
en-unannotated-07712	My latest visit was on Saturday for brunch.
en-unannotated-07713	You have the option of getting the duck medium or medium rare.
en-unannotated-07714	I was twice two days followed and was brilliant, thanks
en-unannotated-07715	Close to other locations.
en-unannotated-07716	Dinner time we were 2.
en-unannotated-07717	We stayed at this hotel during an overnight visit to go to the Columbus Zoo and Cosi.
en-unannotated-07718	We wished we could have stayed longer..
en-unannotated-07719	Hardwood floors and very clean.
en-unannotated-07720	Really enjoyed it here.
en-unannotated-07721	But this is solely listening to music.
en-unannotated-07722	The pozole is the star attraction, a delicious soup with either chicken or pork , great flavor and rich.
en-unannotated-07723	This is a very small restaurant in a very busy area of Temple Bar.
en-unannotated-07724	The food was great!
en-unannotated-07725	When we first walked in, we weren't quite sure if we were in the correct place.
en-unannotated-07726	I ordered the seafood pasta here, which came in a delightfully large portion size but turned out to be mediocre.
en-unannotated-07727	Location!!
en-unannotated-07728	Good variety and taste!
en-unannotated-07729	Friendly atmosphere and fantastic cuisine.
en-unannotated-07730	We changed our room three times.
en-unannotated-07731	The pork special was so good, that it tasted like a fine steak.
en-unannotated-07732	And we arrived late because our walking map took us to the far end of their very long street -- and,...
en-unannotated-07733	and would recommend to anyone who is looking for a delicious lunch in an "off the beaten track" part of Paris.
en-unannotated-07734	Thoroughly enjoyed.
en-unannotated-07735	The food on both occasions was worth every penny.
en-unannotated-07736	Com it was 38 c air conditioning did not work.
en-unannotated-07737	This is where you should go to get a taste of Prague if you only have one meal.
en-unannotated-07738	Protip - Before you go, order a foie sandwich to go (between 11:30 and 8 pm). Amazing and very filling (for 7.50 euros only!!)
en-unannotated-07739	We tried the classic roast beef with cream sauce and a daily special, roasted blade steak with caper sauce over corn puree.
en-unannotated-07740	Everything tasted fresh and juicy though the actual burger itself was quite thin and the stuff around it overpowered it.
en-unannotated-07741	stay for the candlelight food and drink!
en-unannotated-07742	Chose the ten course (short option) degustation menu.
en-unannotated-07743	We all enjoyed ourselves, and it was fun meeting with the people at the other tables.
en-unannotated-07744	The restaurant was great and packed up all of our dinners, which we were able to enjoy back at our hotel (and so was my father-in-law, who luckily just was having a momentary asthma episode).
en-unannotated-07745	Tons of shopping and restaurants within safe walking distance.
en-unannotated-07746	The bed was extremely comfortable and shower was excellent.
en-unannotated-07747	First, an amuse bouche arrived, a bit of toast on toasted bread with a slice of foie gras.
en-unannotated-07748	Steaks and Oysters are at the top of their game here but make sure you order it Medium Rare
en-unannotated-07749	As a $$$ restaurants we have a somewhat higher expectation and so settled on the 4 stars.
en-unannotated-07750	Rooms were large, practical and nice.
en-unannotated-07751	Went there on the recommendation of Trip Advisor.
en-unannotated-07752	- Broken light switch;
en-unannotated-07753	thank you.
en-unannotated-07754	But on truly magical evenings, five stars pop into my mind the moment I walk in and stay there until after I write my review.
en-unannotated-07755	Clean and welcoming.
en-unannotated-07756	We bought prosecco at the super market and enjoyed the terrass when the bar was closed...
en-unannotated-07757	Not luxury at all!
en-unannotated-07758	Anyways they apologised about the glass and the tissue then I went back and I was unpacking my bag I wanted to open to closet to hang my clothes inside and surprisingly the closet was not opening so I called them and they have managed to send two women from housekeeping to fix it.
en-unannotated-07759	If you want a real treat, this is the place.
en-unannotated-07760	EUR 18 per person for 3 courses and what a delight it was.
en-unannotated-07761	First and LAST visit!
en-unannotated-07762	My partner loved the goulash bread bowl.
en-unannotated-07763	Highly recommend to anyone venturing onto eagle street pier for a meal!
en-unannotated-07764	I would recommend this restaurant to a King.
en-unannotated-07765	I'd heard a fair amount of buzz about the place and initially was skeptical, as it was the peak of the burger craze and new joints were popping up everywhere.
en-unannotated-07766	Overall this may be one of the best meals start to finish that I've had especially with such a reasonable price -Tres bien!
en-unannotated-07767	I'm telling you, I laughed the entire night!
en-unannotated-07768	The location was central to business and government.
en-unannotated-07769	- Filthy bathroom, with stains all over;
en-unannotated-07770	I was told that duck cooked right is amazing.
en-unannotated-07771	just do it !
en-unannotated-07772	The food is authentic Mexican food and it is super delicious!
en-unannotated-07773	The...
en-unannotated-07774	It's located about 5 minutes walk to the beach and about 10 minutes walk to the famous tapas or pinxtos bars.
en-unannotated-07775	To our dissapointment there wasn't any choclate cake on the menu.
en-unannotated-07776	Appetizers were great.
en-unannotated-07777	Le Potager de Pere Thierry perfectly encapsulates what French cuisine is truly about and it is because of this that I had one one of the most memorable and fantastic meals here.
en-unannotated-07778	After searching on Yelp, I decided to take my mom here for a redemption meal as we didn't have a good experience at lunch due to what I consider the tourist treatment.
en-unannotated-07779	What a find!
en-unannotated-07780	I would definitely recommend it.
en-unannotated-07781	This is absolutely the best French restaurant my wife and I have visited.
en-unannotated-07782	The pizza is so tasty...
en-unannotated-07783	Overall, it was good.
en-unannotated-07784	Maitia exceeded our expectations!
en-unannotated-07785	Just had 4 nights on a second visit to Hotel Preciados.
en-unannotated-07786	It's a good restaurant offering solid French cuisine with excellent service.
en-unannotated-07787	It's so indulgent because the food is incredibly rich, no matter what you order.
en-unannotated-07788	Alfredo was our restaurant server yesterday evening and greatly represented Marriott service.
en-unannotated-07789	Wonderfully convenient location, on the edge of Plaza Mayor.
en-unannotated-07790	I seriously think you people need to work on it.
en-unannotated-07791	Well ........
en-unannotated-07792	I highly recommend visiting this restaurant if you are in Paris.
en-unannotated-07793	Loved the bathroom with both shower and tub separated.
en-unannotated-07794	The ambience is 70's smart chic and can't rival some of the more popular places by the river that have benefitted from more design, but the food is the real deal.
en-unannotated-07795	Where do I even begin?
en-unannotated-07796	The chef created a very welcoming atmosphere and we enjoyed every single dish we've ordered!
en-unannotated-07797	And everything tasted fantastic.
en-unannotated-07798	Several things stand out to me.
en-unannotated-07799	We've waited long for our meal, but we got some great cheese and the little salty risotto was fixed really fast.
en-unannotated-07800	Best in all of Ireland.
en-unannotated-07801	The entrée that I had was venison carpaccio with bread, which was excellent.
en-unannotated-07802	The dessert selection was overwhelming but we finally settled in the chocolate cake that had a hint of alcohol but was also delicious.
en-unannotated-07803	Food 9/10 service 6/10 decor 8/10
en-unannotated-07804	Between us we were able to try their lamb cutlets in a honey sauce, the spinach brik pie (great but could have had more kick in the pie) and the barramundi.
en-unannotated-07805	You can tell it once was but an investment to bring back the justification in price is necessary.
en-unannotated-07806	If you are not scared, they have pastries too...
en-unannotated-07807	Salad was good once you seasoned it.
en-unannotated-07808	We popped in on a Saturday night, when the streets were full outside.
en-unannotated-07809	We stumbled upon this restaurant while walking around the Red Square/GUM area.
en-unannotated-07810	It lacked that true burger taste of beefy, charbroiled goodness with bits of burnt crust from the grill marks.
en-unannotated-07811	We had brunch here rather than our hotel, staff are excellent too.
en-unannotated-07812	I travel constantly for business so when I travel for leisure I have high expectations.
en-unannotated-07813	its not worth checking out
en-unannotated-07814	Cooked al dente but still able to fully absorb the sauce it was cooked in.
en-unannotated-07815	I Took my wife here for our 15th Wedding anniversary.
en-unannotated-07816	However..
en-unannotated-07817	Both dishes were divine.
en-unannotated-07818	The rooms are very good but starting to fade.
en-unannotated-07819	I visited with my wife and two children 7-9. The waiter was fantastic, we let him select or meal and he did a great job serving...
en-unannotated-07820	They even brought out a little candle on it and sang happy birthday.
en-unannotated-07821	The warm goat cheese was extraordinary in that it was the creamiest cheese I've eaten, and the semi-bitter, semi-sweet red beet mouse really complimented the cheese well.
en-unannotated-07822	I informed her that they had no problem moving us to a suite when our room wasn't available so what was the problem.
en-unannotated-07823	My friends and I had a great stay while visiting Mexico City.
en-unannotated-07824	Trust me, go else where.
en-unannotated-07825	Being skipping distance from the Astronomical Clock, every table at Mlejnice Kožná was filled with the tourist crush.
en-unannotated-07826	We pretty much picked one item from each section of the menu to share.
en-unannotated-07827	I loved the fact that there were seats.
en-unannotated-07828	Attentive and relaxed service, exquisitely prepared meals at a reasonable price.
en-unannotated-07829	Pass.
en-unannotated-07830	The toilet was wedged in the corner next to the sink.
en-unannotated-07831	And therefore the highest disappointment when expectations were not met.
en-unannotated-07832	The public areas are beautiful.
en-unannotated-07833	Doors connecting with balcony and stairs don't lock.
en-unannotated-07834	Amazing location.
en-unannotated-07835	You had a choice of whiskey our bourbon, mixed with just the right amount of bitters and simple syrup.
en-unannotated-07836	This was my favorite meal in Paris!
en-unannotated-07837	We had 2 entrees, bottle of wine, an appetizer, a soup, and each had an after dinner drink: final bill was 125 euros.
en-unannotated-07838	Perfect for business.
en-unannotated-07839	Located in the heart of Prague right on the main town square.
en-unannotated-07840	The Toad Rally and Kingdom Builder features are really cool, too.
en-unannotated-07841	Savory pancakes need to become a thing in the US, for sure.
en-unannotated-07842	Best of all great helpful reception.
en-unannotated-07843	Trecce carbonara: I was in heaven, half way through our meal the chef appeared with a frying pan and asked if I would like another serving.
en-unannotated-07844	I am tempted to give this 2 stars because the duck breast I ordered looked nice but the meat was so tough and chewy I only ate half of it.
en-unannotated-07845	Thanx guys in 4 years of dinning brisbane i must say you are the best all round with amazing food flavours and service.
en-unannotated-07846	The menu changes based on the season.

en-unannotated-07852	After asking him 3 times to understand what he was saying, very surprised I ask him: I just got out from work, had one pint with my friends and you are saying to me that I'm drunk and stepped on you?

en-unannotated-07858	We also shared the crab cannelloni.
en-unannotated-07859	When I mentioned this to my server, he exclaimed that one dish was enough for me!
en-unannotated-07860	It was a tad salty but I guess it's the norm since it tasted salty everywhere else.
en-unannotated-07861	Also the outside terrace ...
en-unannotated-07862	From the moment of your arrival, you're treated exceptionally well.
en-unannotated-07863	We arrived very late at night and despite the fact that we were more than 200 people checking in, they managed to do things in a reasonable organized way.

en-unannotated-07865	Everything was delicious.

en-unannotated-07901	Den Noc is a small eatery in the city center.
en-unannotated-07902	The 2 dishes plus 2 giant beers came out to around 430 Czech Koruna (which equals about $17 USD). Whether you want to just stop by for a cheap beer or are looking for a full meal, I recommend giving this place a try!

en-unannotated-07914	There were quite a few local people watching football which made for a nice atmosphere (except that the Corse team lost and so they...
en-unannotated-07915	Very central for all Sightseeing Stops in Rome (Walk: 5 minutes to the Pantheon, 8 minutes to Piazza Navona, 15 minutes zu Collosseum and Castello St.
en-unannotated-07916	The staff here is nice and speak great English.
en-unannotated-07917	The pie was great as there was plenty of prosciutto and parm, which was enjoyable for us non cheese lovers as it wasn't too strong and didn't overpower the dish.

en-unannotated-07927	Make sure to make a reservation as this is a small place- it was booked the night we went and the host had to turn people away.
en-unannotated-07928	I was very disappointed with this app.
en-unannotated-07929	He got lamb, which was a large cut on the bone and came with potato and veg, it was perfectly cooked and fell from the bone.
en-unannotated-07930	They sadly fell apart when you peeled them.

en-unannotated-07936	The meal was decently priced, and the gnocchi (although not five-star, melt-in-your-mouth soft pillows) was rather enjoyable.
en-unannotated-07937	SWEET, DELICIOUS MISTAKE.
en-unannotated-07938	So after hearing nothing but amazing things about Miel Container, I finally got around to checking it out a few weeks ago for a Friday lunch.

en-unannotated-07940	Great staff.
en-unannotated-07941	The dishes are always fresh and piping hot.
en-unannotated-07942	guy and one of the reception guy were very condescending!

en-unannotated-07944	This place is a little out of the way, but it has excellent risotto, well worth it.
en-unannotated-07945	Was really thrilled to find this little cosy cafe in the Gogol-Museum in the centre of Moscow.
en-unannotated-07946	Great breakfast.
en-unannotated-07947	Must visit in Milan!
en-unannotated-07948	But it was sparse on storage.
en-unannotated-07949	They had and octopus and also a bigger than like cold cuts plate but we were going to Greece the next day and we already are charcuterie non stop throughout the whole day so those were not an option.
en-unannotated-07950	We have very good experience with Melia hotels elsewhere, so this was somewhat disappointing.
en-unannotated-07951	The pasta dish was definitely entree sized for me.
en-unannotated-07952	There are rooms with a good view to the Chapultepec.
en-unannotated-07953	Service was...
en-unannotated-07954	Different people learning about eachother and sharing conversations...
en-unannotated-07955	We finished off with a shared dessert of strawberry tart and baileys coffees which were perfection.
en-unannotated-07956	There is a wedding hall on the right side and dining area for regular guests on the left where we had our dinner.
en-unannotated-07957	This is one of those little gems, after seeing the reviews on Trip Adviser we decided to try CalidaDe.
en-unannotated-07958	The coffee and hot choc range is great!
en-unannotated-07959	Its located 5 mins from all the action which we felt was a message in disguise.

en-unannotated-07964	All of this and so much more describes the...
en-unannotated-07965	Some staff in dining room were very unhelpful so made my breakfast experience disappointing.

en-unannotated-07967	cold cut were not good etc
en-unannotated-07968	The meal was super delicious and the price was fair.
en-unannotated-07969	You could immediately sense the...
en-unannotated-07970	More like twice a day really.
en-unannotated-07971	I think each draft beer was about 5.80 euros, very reasonable for an average bar and surprisingly inexpensive for a nice place like the Bank.
en-unannotated-07972	Located in a small street close to the old town of Ajaccio, this place offers fresh and well prepared meals that are adapted to the market and the season.
en-unannotated-07973	it's literally in front of the american embassy.
en-unannotated-07974	Service was ok and the prices alrights.
en-unannotated-07975	Focused' inbox  as strangely  enough you put the wrong emails there.
en-unannotated-07976	Then my dessert came and this too was beautiful and delicious.
en-unannotated-07977	So I came here to try the salmon on bagel everyone is talking about, unfortunately they ran out of bagel so I had to go with the chicken sandwich.
en-unannotated-07978	Thanks to Mike and Natalia that at 1AM on 15 May, they found two rooms for us.
en-unannotated-07979	We had a wonderful time in Madrid and Splendom Suites Gran Via was the perfect place to stay.
en-unannotated-07980	We each ordered one boxty with no appetizers, and that was enough to satisfy our appetites without leaving us totally stuffed.
en-unannotated-07981	The dessert: the red fruit crumble and the white chocolate mousse.
en-unannotated-07982	In every bite there was chunks of panchette which was great.
en-unannotated-07983	If this doesn't have a Michelin star, I think it soon will.
en-unannotated-07984	There are also a variety of seating options that are available, from cushion type of chairs, to 2-seaters, 4-seaters, and a large table.
en-unannotated-07985	But not up to a Leading Hotel.
en-unannotated-07986	Walls was paper thin.
en-unannotated-07987	Aurora creates a special mood with her creative decor, her friendliness, and the delicious food that she serves.
en-unannotated-07988	Don't stay there.
en-unannotated-07989	Paired with an excellent pouilly-fume.
en-unannotated-07990	What an amazing sleep, and what amazing set ups and decor in the guestrooms...
en-unannotated-07991	You know those places where you go the first time and try a dish that is so good, every time you return you wouldn't even consider ordering anything else?
en-unannotated-07992	I was hungry by an hour...
en-unannotated-07993	Great and helpful staff.
en-unannotated-07994	My husband, 2 grown children and I joined 7 other guests for an incredible dining experience hosted by Xavi and Nico.
en-unannotated-07995	Many, many, many times there has been no notification of a new email.
en-unannotated-07996	Then she came back and said they were out of croissants and asked us to choose a...
en-unannotated-07997	A line developed outside of the restaurant just as we were finishing our dinner, and from that point forward we kept hearing loud complaints from the hostess/waitress about how busy the restaurant is which made us diners feel unappreciated, and the negative vibe began affecting the mood of the place....
en-unannotated-07998	Located in a middle of shopping districts, easy access and security.
en-unannotated-07999	it makes it hard to see what you're doing!
en-unannotated-08000	I walked in around 2 or 3 pm on a Wednesday and was able to get a table without issues, but it did get busier as I sat there.
en-unannotated-08001	Small, nice fitout, good service but I found myself wanting to be somewhere with more vibe.
en-unannotated-08002	Great service and very nice accomodations.
en-unannotated-08003	Room was very clean and [name] and the other staff was very seviceminded and helped us with all the indormation we asked for.
en-unannotated-08004	I get the "something happened, try again later" error
en-unannotated-08005	This hotel exceeded all my expectations.
en-unannotated-08006	We came here because of the other good reviews.
en-unannotated-08007	The foam for the espresso drinks were especially creamy, and the pancakes we ordered were creative and delicious.
en-unannotated-08008	The beer and water are on tap.
en-unannotated-08009	They also have a minimum of $15 for you to use a credit card...
en-unannotated-08010	He ordered it 7 times during our trip; 4 times in Rome alone.
en-unannotated-08011	The menus a blast to read but as we were only two, Yuri suggested splitting the Eggplant caviar salad (no caviar eggs) which was baked eggplant pulp with chickpeas, cream, spices and vegetables.
en-unannotated-08012	We don't speak Spanish but they helped us order exactly what we wanted and it was cheap and delicious!
en-unannotated-08013	The coffee is amazing.
en-unannotated-08014	Eat here, you will not regret it.
en-unannotated-08015	Louis and we were very happy with our choice.
en-unannotated-08016	I had a goat cheese and Apple...
en-unannotated-08017	Foie pasta with truffle sauce: SUPER RICH.
en-unannotated-08018	Food was absolutely amazing, the presentation I have to say was 10/10. I went there for the 2 for 1 brunch offer they had for one day and one day only- I was surprised to see very little people availing of this fantastic promotion but luckily i came across it on facebook.
en-unannotated-08019	The red velvet cake was wonderful!
en-unannotated-08020	I felt that I had to comment on this restaurant.
en-unannotated-08021	It would be a shame to select any dish in particular from this varied and exceptional menu.
en-unannotated-08022	Do not think of it as a french onion soup but it was much lighter with far less cheese.
en-unannotated-08023	Nicholas Church "a four minute walk.
en-unannotated-08024	My daughters Mango Mouse was also very good, and the bananas Flambe was a big hit too.
en-unannotated-08025	From the wine to the meal, pairings are explained and suggested.
en-unannotated-08026	EVER.
en-unannotated-08027	We waited a long time for the server to take our order.
en-unannotated-08028	Excellent place to stay 😎👍. The breakfast was amazing [name] was our waiter very polite; he gave us a great service.
en-unannotated-08029	Beautiful boutique hotel.
en-unannotated-08030	This is a very good hotel.
en-unannotated-08031	We wanted our food!
en-unannotated-08032	The French Onion soup was so flavorful!
en-unannotated-08033	It was very good, although my only complaint is that the duck was slightly tougher than normal.
en-unannotated-08034	Fantastic ambience.
en-unannotated-08035	Might want to invest in better lights or something, even if it's meant to have a dark subdued atmosphere...
en-unannotated-08036	Apple cobbler: This was pretty good.
en-unannotated-08037	Food is decent, just not spectacular.
en-unannotated-08038	Registration was oppressive, with us even having to provide proof that our son was indeed our son.
en-unannotated-08039	I think something's wrong with this as it does not show my matches or even messages.
en-unannotated-08040	My husband had the escargot to start, and it was divine.
en-unannotated-08041	Absolutely Scrumptious!!!
en-unannotated-08042	Place was very popular with the local residents and very welcoming to tourists.
en-unannotated-08043	We wanted to experience good French food and wow did we.
en-unannotated-08044	I can't believe that so much character can be packed into an establishment so central in the CBD.
en-unannotated-08045	Stayed for two nights, modern hotel, clean room on HiltonHonors floor, good WiFi, above average breakfast buffet, friendly staff.
en-unannotated-08046	I was back in the Hotel in occasion of a Congress.
en-unannotated-08047	and that is saying Something!
en-unannotated-08048	My only complaints are when you get a challenge they don't show up in your messages and I'm rarely playing against a player from my region.
en-unannotated-08049	Very annoying
en-unannotated-08050	We went there for dinner a few weeks ago and took the chef's menu (1 appetizer, 2 starters, 2 mains, 1 dessert) for €43. It was absolutely great from start to finish, with unusual combinations (cold beef with beetroots - delicious !!)
en-unannotated-08051	Found it through Yelp of course and decided to check it out.
en-unannotated-08052	Fish of the day totally tasteless as were the vegetables served with it.
en-unannotated-08053	Price: 5 stars, Service: 5 stars, Ambiance: 5 stars
en-unannotated-08054	Overall you have to try this spot, Great stuff!!
en-unannotated-08055	Awesome, with creative dishes for a good price.
en-unannotated-08056	Being the oldest pub in Ireland says many things about the place like withstanding the test of time.
en-unannotated-08057	Additionally, they lent us cellphones with working internet and free calls to some countries (like the U.S)
en-unannotated-08058	The other is for you, I am not going on in my head and shoulders, I was just the same thing as well, I was just the same.
en-unannotated-08059	It's a burger joint, so you know what to expect, but they really make awesome burgers at a reasonable price.
en-unannotated-08060	As residents of Iowa, which is the largest pork producing state in the US, it is not lightly that I say this was the best pork I've ever eaten.
en-unannotated-08061	Amanda really liked the rabbit she had here as well.
en-unannotated-08062	I almost don't want to leave this review because I don't want this place to get busier, it's my secret gem!
en-unannotated-08063	The place is also a butcher shop and during peak times, it gets very crowded.
en-unannotated-08064	When you go abroad, people often tell you to go see the Eiffel Tower or the Taj Mahal, or whatever else seems like a good idea to see.
en-unannotated-08065	The bf and I are visiting from the U.S. , and showed up around 11:30 to energize ourselves before a long day of sightseeing.
en-unannotated-08066	The VERY BEST dish was a fall pumpkin soup with roasted chestnuts and creme fraiche.
en-unannotated-08067	I have stayed in this hotel already many times.
en-unannotated-08068	Altogether a great place to eat and enjoy beer without the hassle of booking in advance (parties of 8 or...
en-unannotated-08069	I try to stay away from too expensive places and look for true experiences and great food.
en-unannotated-08070	Overall, not a bad experience, but not a great one either.
en-unannotated-08071	Obviously the beer of choice is Guinness-must get!
en-unannotated-08072	This restaurant makes you feel welcome like no other restaurant I went too in Italy.
en-unannotated-08073	Enjoyable evening.
en-unannotated-08074	My husband had the duck, which was prepared in a way that reminded him of beef bourguignon.
en-unannotated-08075	Staff is awesome and very friendly.
en-unannotated-08076	Give us a map and place to visit.
en-unannotated-08077	The beauty of the amazing ceilings at the lounge area stole our hearts.
en-unannotated-08078	Both the coffee and breakfast were really good, probably the best we had during our entire trip to Spain.
en-unannotated-08079	Great service, thoroughly recommend .
en-unannotated-08080	Jardin de Recoletos is an oasis amidst the hassle and bustle of Madrid.
en-unannotated-08081	Extremely fresh and delicious food.
en-unannotated-08082	I wouldn't recommend it for...
en-unannotated-08083	Couldn't make sandwiches because of the oven.
en-unannotated-08084	Looking for stuff we don't have a back in the states.
en-unannotated-08085	Not average but not very good the place is cosy and basic, myself and a friend ordered the Tamales and we're pleasantly surprised with healthy portion sizes for a cheap price!
en-unannotated-08086	Lol.
en-unannotated-08087	Staff: they speak several languages, at the very least you will find someone that speaks Spanish and English.
en-unannotated-08088	But...
en-unannotated-08089	I've emailed the company asking for a reason and it's been over a month and ive still heard nothing back.
en-unannotated-08090	Our waitress was so sweet and kind and helped us translate..
en-unannotated-08091	But then you get those restaurants close to tourist hotels that push tripadvisor reviews and this is exactly what you get.
en-unannotated-08092	Not a luxury hotel but a very good no fuss one with full amenities and excellent service.
en-unannotated-08093	Great Food in a nice atmosphere.
en-unannotated-08094	A big plus to the hotel.
en-unannotated-08095	Coming from NY and have been to Italy I...
en-unannotated-08096	They simply refused to give us water with our meals.
en-unannotated-08097	We were the first ones there (maybe shortly after they opened) and the place (which seats about 26 tightly) had filled up by the time we left, almost entirely with English speakers.
en-unannotated-08098	We debated whether or not to give a 4 or 5, and decided upon the 4 because although the food was great we also didn't find it as good as many of the $$ restaurants we visited.
en-unannotated-08099	And it was divine.
en-unannotated-08100	Everything tasted extremely flavorful and buttery.
en-unannotated-08101	Stop trying to cheat tourists ...
en-unannotated-08102	Breakfast was 50 euros and incredibly poor!
en-unannotated-08103	The Caprini appetizer was great.
en-unannotated-08104	Step inside from the busting central city zone into the protected elegance of a small, genteel, and quiet hotel.
en-unannotated-08105	Visites this restaurant twice during our stay in Bonifacio.
en-unannotated-08106	I am in awe.
en-unannotated-08107	I made the choice based on Trip Advisor reviews and we have been pleased.
en-unannotated-08108	But the way, if u walk, it is a great place to start a long walk through the city past the Pantheon, down to the Luxomberg gardens and then continue walking to see many beautiful streets, u can even pass Notre Dam on your way to the musee Rodin.
en-unannotated-08109	2/ the design: it has a lot of character - stylish, elegant, nicely old fashioned
en-unannotated-08110	Friendly on your tongue, stomach, and your wallet!!!
en-unannotated-08111	The walls are filthy and covered with stains
en-unannotated-08112	For main I got pan fried cod which came with a potato hash, asparagus and caviar, which I haven had before and wont be bothering my arse with again, even if I'm bribed with a Bollinger accompaniment.
en-unannotated-08113	On the other hand the bread was fresh and absolutely to die for..
en-unannotated-08114	U can not custimize your character without robux, well at least customize them good.
en-unannotated-08115	Be prepared to be closely tucked in and sitting two inches from the next table.
en-unannotated-08116	The custom burger packed bags of flavour with the blue sauce providing a nice kick without overpowering it.
en-unannotated-08117	My boyfriend ordered one that had the same without tomatoes.
en-unannotated-08118	By chance we wondered into 'Vincci The Mint' where staff immediately greeted us.
en-unannotated-08119	One elevator of the two never worked and never appeared to be under immediate repair.
en-unannotated-08120	The food is simple but of good quality.
en-unannotated-08121	While being a popular haunt for the people of Brisbane, Brew's tucked-away location, as well as its mood lighting and decor, makes you feel like you've stumbled upon a unique gem.
en-unannotated-08122	Definitely going back and I would highly recommend.
en-unannotated-08123	Bit of a dissappointment.
en-unannotated-08124	The only thing I would change is the music loop.
en-unannotated-08125	I don't think I've ever seen a bigger piece of foie gras in my life for just 12 euros!
en-unannotated-08126	I absolutely recommend this place.
en-unannotated-08127	Good value.
en-unannotated-08128	Bright, clean, well decorated.
en-unannotated-08129	[name]- the receptionist - was especially very nice
en-unannotated-08130	The steak and canard were both overcooked.
en-unannotated-08131	In fact this restaurant is closed in August.
en-unannotated-08132	Upon entering the overall space has a huge feel to it, but once you realize the mirrors on the wall, you realize it's smaller than the eye sees.
en-unannotated-08133	Would definitely come back here again if I am in Paris.
en-unannotated-08134	Ordered the spaghetti w black squid ink.
en-unannotated-08135	the dinning room was a lovely place
en-unannotated-08136	Stayed in September 2016. Rooms are great - spacious and modern.
en-unannotated-08137	It starts with the booking😀. Its not a restaurant, but an appartement?
en-unannotated-08138	Definitely a fun place to go and feel like you are really home.
en-unannotated-08139	The only problem you may have is deciding what cider to try!
en-unannotated-08140	The recommendation for main meal from the server was their chicken preparation, Fricassee de Volaille.
en-unannotated-08141	My bistec charro was...
en-unannotated-08142	WE LOVED IT, stayed for one week with every aspect of our visit being outstanding.
en-unannotated-08143	Aer lingus  is brilliant they were  a great help a couple year ago when I missed a flight they help me get a later flight and did not rip me off
en-unannotated-08144	Staff were very helpful.
en-unannotated-08145	This is the great place for rest after hard working day!
en-unannotated-08146	Now I need to force stop the app 50 times a day or doesn8work.
en-unannotated-08147	Great experience with great people at the table.
en-unannotated-08148	Was genuine Corsican Auberge a must go nice selection of Corsican wine and great corsican dishes it will make you feel somewhere else.
en-unannotated-08149	The dish comes with fresh salad.
en-unannotated-08150	The rooms are just at the limit of comfort .
en-unannotated-08151	Amazing combination of flavors, textures and presentation.
en-unannotated-08152	Staff are friendly, servings of a range of pasta's generous, fresh and quick.
en-unannotated-08153	To my surprise, I was quite pleased.
en-unannotated-08154	There is quite literally nothing I can critique about it.
en-unannotated-08155	It's such a world away from the ultra-corporate feel of the streets less than 100 ft away.
en-unannotated-08156	Look after the problem and then I will give 5 stars
en-unannotated-08157	They don't really know wtf they r doing I suppose
en-unannotated-08158	Even thought the hotel is right beside the Camino the hotel staff had no clue what we where saying when we asked about the Camino.
en-unannotated-08159	No reservations needed on this Tuesday night.
en-unannotated-08160	I'm not a vegetarian but my girlfriend is.
en-unannotated-08161	But boy, is it a good time.
en-unannotated-08162	So for a traditional Czech meal DO NOT go anywhere else.
en-unannotated-08163	Excellent riverfront location.
en-unannotated-08164	Very attentive and knowledgeable staff.
en-unannotated-08165	thumbs up for the decor & wood on the walls
en-unannotated-08166	We would definitely stay here again, even if our business meeting were at other hotels.
en-unannotated-08167	My first cocktail was the Bees Knees, and it speaks for itself!
en-unannotated-08168	Much higher quality food than the rest of options in the Plaza for its price range.
en-unannotated-08169	always ask them first.
en-unannotated-08170	Fantastic value, flavour sensation and great service - I can't believe it's taken me this long to get there.
en-unannotated-08171	Location was fantastic.
en-unannotated-08172	The service is good and friendly.
en-unannotated-08173	I chose the chicken and Brie toasted.
en-unannotated-08174	The French can do duck kike no other.
en-unannotated-08175	Couldn't ask for more location wise.
en-unannotated-08176	First time in Madrid, stayed here as part of group tour with Trafalgar.
en-unannotated-08177	They still have garlic soup on the menu, a personal favorite that has been slowly getting harder to find in Mexico City.
en-unannotated-08178	Great Barolo wine and great people.
en-unannotated-08179	and cost us €16. Love...
en-unannotated-08180	It's located inside a cave and has huge dramatic stone ceilings and walls which would have been totally awesome if the place hadn't smelt musty and moldy and had the decor been updated any more recently than when it opened back in the 12th century and was visited by King Charles IV.
en-unannotated-08181	It is located in the Reforma Avenue.
en-unannotated-08182	Now, I know TA ratings have to be taken with a pinch of salt sometimes - 3 of the current top 20...
en-unannotated-08183	Very courteous and helpful staff.
en-unannotated-08184	The pesto pasta and the carbonara pasta were delicious.
en-unannotated-08185	Came here with my husband for lunch.
en-unannotated-08186	Visited this Hotel for a couple of days back in May.
en-unannotated-08187	I had lunch here on a weekday.
en-unannotated-08188	The staff was very friendly, and especially the late night reception service had a good personal feel to it.
en-unannotated-08189	A.
en-unannotated-08190	This is a must visit for anyone in Dublin who can drink and listen to music.
en-unannotated-08191	The service is top notch and the food is delicious, as you would expect.
en-unannotated-08192	We pass through Bogata frequently and will stay here again in the future.
en-unannotated-08193	I recommend the upstairs dining room if you can get it.
en-unannotated-08194	Reasonable prices, friendly staff.
en-unannotated-08195	It is charming, service oriented, has a beautiful garden and since the redo has beautiful rooms.
en-unannotated-08196	Room and Location.
en-unannotated-08197	Every single one, no joke, is on a timer for when you can skip it.
en-unannotated-08198	then you developers can make it cheaper
en-unannotated-08199	The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly.
en-unannotated-08200	I had a burger and my partner had the Sausage special.
en-unannotated-08201	We suggested that, being in Rome, a proper coffee machine would be a nice addition; feedback was taken on board!
en-unannotated-08202	One of my closest friends has been raving about the food here for ages so I finally got to try it yesterday.
en-unannotated-08203	Wonderful friendly service and excellent lunch
en-unannotated-08204	Amazing
en-unannotated-08205	We had lunch at this little underground restaurant (like so many are), over the river in San Sebastián.
en-unannotated-08206	I spent a few days in CDMX and heard that this restaurant was good.
en-unannotated-08207	Now the food menu isn't as expansive but provides some great sustenance none the less.
en-unannotated-08208	She spoke so fast and so quietly that it was impossible to tell what she was saying or if she actually got the order correct.
en-unannotated-08209	I was enticed here by my daughter, a combination between designer sushi bar and baritos .
en-unannotated-08210	Great hosts, and food.
en-unannotated-08211	I arrived at lunch time so there were no bands playing.
en-unannotated-08212	The room was beautiful.
en-unannotated-08213	I did overhear that the beef stew is pretty amazing so maybe people should go for that instead of the boxty.
en-unannotated-08214	The JW lives up to its brand name, and provides excellent attention to its guests.
en-unannotated-08215	Recommendation, "Pay it forward" if given the chance, if you have an opportunity to have open places at your table as I did, tell the bartender/server to invite any couple or single to sit with you.
en-unannotated-08216	They even had menus in English for us.
en-unannotated-08217	The bed was so soft and relaxing that I didn't want to get up in the morning.
en-unannotated-08218	If you're not into seafood, stir clear from this because it is straight up a seafood type of dish...
en-unannotated-08219	Um, no, just no.
en-unannotated-08220	For some reason, I remembered the location of the hotel from my previous visits to this great city.
en-unannotated-08221	I wish we weren't leaving tomorrow so we could come back again!
en-unannotated-08222	Overall, I think this is an excellent hotel.
en-unannotated-08223	Because of this, it's quite loud so don't expect a romantic, slow-paced Italian meal.
en-unannotated-08224	Matiz is kind of the go to place for top notch cuisine for those of us residing in Bogota.
en-unannotated-08225	The apple, ginger cracker, and foie combo was delicious.
en-unannotated-08226	Simply delicious, we had a beer goulash in a loaf of bread and a roasted duck leg.
en-unannotated-08227	They made the whole experience even better.
en-unannotated-08228	Went with the waitresses favorite, pork and spinach, and was not disappointed.
en-unannotated-08229	$70 for oysters for two is excessive by any standard.
en-unannotated-08230	On the negative side, there are few seats, it's mostly always crowded and if you like air con you're going to be disappointed.
en-unannotated-08231	The place is small...
en-unannotated-08232	I'd recommend not coming with more than 4 people, however.
en-unannotated-08233	Would've liked to have had more caviar sampling but will leave that for next time!...
en-unannotated-08234	We ate at this restaurant for two days.
en-unannotated-08235	She relented and moved us to another room, this one much better.
en-unannotated-08236	During our stay it was maintenance is going on and we could not had enough sleep
en-unannotated-08237	The amazing food was perfectly executed well prepared and presented.
en-unannotated-08238	The hotel was clean, breakfast was good and staff were friendly.
en-unannotated-08239	However, for my birthday, my best friend and I put on our finest clothes and jewelry and ventured into Jellyfish.
en-unannotated-08240	App is pure horrible.
en-unannotated-08241	location can't be beat in Rome , breakfast is very good and convenient .
en-unannotated-08242	I love color switch so much!
en-unannotated-08243	Get your beer here and the food some place else.
en-unannotated-08244	Wifi was intermittent - not good enough :(
en-unannotated-08245	Came here with the family for lunch.
en-unannotated-08246	Yes please.
en-unannotated-08247	The staff at the hotel were fantastic, organising a Doctor and accompanying us to the Clinic.
en-unannotated-08248	Had lunch here - ordered the daily menu.
en-unannotated-08249	But, if you're looking for great food, come here!
en-unannotated-08250	The beers came out fast.
en-unannotated-08251	A fantastic place if you want to soak up the afternoon and mellow out into the early evening!
en-unannotated-08252	Service was excellent.
en-unannotated-08253	I've had duck meat ravioli a lot of times but foie gras ravioli was my first time and I loved the cream, the pasta and the foie gras.
en-unannotated-08254	Service timely, friendly and well-informed.
en-unannotated-08255	My friend and I were super thrilled how good they are!!!
en-unannotated-08256	The meat platter was plenty and definitely satisfies your cured meat cravings.
en-unannotated-08257	When my table got the bill, we were surprised to see that the waiter had given us unprecedented discounts for both our desserts and our drinks!
en-unannotated-08258	The lemon cream one really surprised us.
en-unannotated-08259	Great location overlooking the city.
en-unannotated-08260	The vegetables were cooked perfectly for my liking (with some bite left in them). The waitstaff was friendly and attentive.
en-unannotated-08261	The menu has a sweet and savoury side for pancakes.
en-unannotated-08262	prices were reasonable, with a cocktail on the side!
en-unannotated-08263	There is no kettle .
en-unannotated-08264	Everyone takes the extra mile in what they do to meet your expectations.
en-unannotated-08265	And my plate had three of them.
en-unannotated-08266	Both were made with really...
en-unannotated-08267	Just updated the app and now I can no longer play when I login.
en-unannotated-08268	This game is very easy to play and waisting your time  And  U lose your mind is crazy.
en-unannotated-08269	Every detail was perfect.
en-unannotated-08270	WOW, perfection again !!!!
en-unannotated-08271	Staff was very accommodating and went above and beyond to meet all of our needs.
en-unannotated-08272	The fresh bread made "wiping" the plates easy and the desert and coffee were good too.
en-unannotated-08273	The bf enjoyed his New York stole burger, and we assume that the two small pieces of hot dog made it the 'New York style'. He had it without the bleu cheese crumbles, and enjoyed it very much.
en-unannotated-08274	The late check out at 1pm was a plus, and they extended until 2 pm.
en-unannotated-08275	Simply beautiful!
en-unannotated-08276	I had a delicious seared mackerel with heirloom tomato salad, fresh baked brown bread, and chips.
en-unannotated-08277	Sadly they had none.
en-unannotated-08278	The beer is absolutely amazing, they educate you on the pours, and very cheap for the amount you get.
en-unannotated-08279	In true brisbane style and can-do attitude of utilizing every forsaken alleyway, brew is my ultimate alleyway gem.
en-unannotated-08280	We also had a great wine selection as well.
en-unannotated-08281	Just stop.
en-unannotated-08282	Unfortunately only the ambience was really stunning.
en-unannotated-08283	I will return and hopefully boost it up to 5 stars!
en-unannotated-08284	Popular Italian restaurant for lunch.
en-unannotated-08285	First..
en-unannotated-08286	He asked me where we found out about the place, because usually some of the hotels around won't recommend their guests about this restaurant.
en-unannotated-08287	A must while in Paris,,,
en-unannotated-08288	We didn't have a reservation but they could have us for an hour( which was enough). The service was quick and the food was amazing!!
en-unannotated-08289	I even got several food tasting sample for free...
en-unannotated-08290	The vanilla ice cream in particular, for which I have a reference point, was quite good.
en-unannotated-08291	It was so wonderful to try vintage recipes.
en-unannotated-08292	Would reccommed on all counts especailly if you appreciate classic old world surroundings.
en-unannotated-08293	Beautiful spaces within the hotel, attentive service and lovely staff.
en-unannotated-08294	I would say make reservations if you are able to, especially on Saturdays, they do accept walk-ins and are worth the wait.
en-unannotated-08295	First this restaurant is a family owned business.
en-unannotated-08296	Lastly, we got the gateau du chocolate to share-so spectacular.
en-unannotated-08297	Hotel staff go above and beyond to make everything perfect.
en-unannotated-08298	The outside sitting is in a courtyard.
en-unannotated-08299	Appetizer, main course, and dessert were a prix fixe 36 Euro or $45 a person.
en-unannotated-08300	I will agree with the other reviews.
en-unannotated-08301	Rooms were very comfortable.
en-unannotated-08302	Presentation was impressive, with deep fried pasta sticks under the oysters, simple but effective.
en-unannotated-08303	My words don't do this amazing establishment justice so come check it out for yourself!
en-unannotated-08304	Nope not at all.
en-unannotated-08305	The male sizes small and expensive
en-unannotated-08306	Would recommend 10/10!
en-unannotated-08307	i updated this and since then im facing problems...
en-unannotated-08308	Tucked down an alley in the city is Brew bar, cafe by day, bar by night.
en-unannotated-08309	I stayed in the Hilton Bogota for 1 week on a business trip and was very impressed.
en-unannotated-08310	Everything was good at Only You Atocha.
en-unannotated-08311	Pauline - amazing!
en-unannotated-08312	English menus!!
en-unannotated-08313	Very nice and cosy place in the middle of Arbat.
en-unannotated-08314	Near Panthéon and you need to call ahead for reservations !
en-unannotated-08315	We made reservations and strolled on ease to this restaurant since it was a few blocks away from Radisson Blu Hotel where we were staying at.
en-unannotated-08316	Service was great.
en-unannotated-08317	It is not working!
en-unannotated-08318	My husband ordered lamb with fries.
en-unannotated-08319	We had a tasting menu with...
en-unannotated-08320	Friendly service.
en-unannotated-08321	I'm not claiming to be the best looking guy in the world but that's very uncommon for me.
en-unannotated-08322	Just adorable .
en-unannotated-08323	Beautiful setting, excellent service, wonderful chocolate dessert, forgettable bland meal.
en-unannotated-08324	We had the place to ourselves at noon but it quickly began to fill up.
en-unannotated-08325	The food is very good!
en-unannotated-08326	Spot on.
en-unannotated-08327	Service is very nice, and...
en-unannotated-08328	For food they were unfortunately out of the green eggs which I really wanted to try so we settled for the avocado toast with added bacon and prosciutto toastie.
en-unannotated-08329	Great room, quite spacious.
en-unannotated-08330	I would have happily given my 5 stars and called it a day, but we went back at night for cocktails.
en-unannotated-08331	In the U.S. I've never been handed a garlic clove w my tartare but the intensity it adds to the dish really is a game changer.
en-unannotated-08332	There is an intoxicating aroma emanating from this place.
en-unannotated-08333	Tried carrot cupcake, cheesecake, macaroons and Santiago cake.
en-unannotated-08334	The service was quite fast, although the restaurant was very full.
en-unannotated-08335	When the kitchen opened, I ordered the Penne al salmone and my boyfriend ordered the bolognese.
en-unannotated-08336	Excellent service and cute red and white table checkered tables.
en-unannotated-08337	Really cool vibe with a lot of different craft beers.
en-unannotated-08338	The staff are all extremely helpful; My partner is a light sleeper and the first night we found our room a little noisy.
en-unannotated-08339	This hotel does not deserve it's 5 star rating!
en-unannotated-08340	My friend got the schnitzel, which he thoroughly enjoyed.
en-unannotated-08341	A full fine dining experience was offered, the cloth napkin was placed on my lap, my glass of water was filled when it was at near empty, upselling was in full swing, but I liked it.
en-unannotated-08342	Chef [name] & his GF were friendly & the food was spectacular.
en-unannotated-08343	I really enjoyed the stay.
en-unannotated-08344	So delicious.
en-unannotated-08345	I was a little nervous about eating raw meat in a different country but the server highly recommended it.
en-unannotated-08346	Prices were the most reasonable considering the excellent service and food presentation.
en-unannotated-08347	next time we'll definitely make a reservation
en-unannotated-08348	I would highly recommend.
en-unannotated-08349	I could eat this dish every day, and I'm not even a big meat eater.
en-unannotated-08350	Only cutlets was very crispy and tasty!
en-unannotated-08351	So many freaking bots on here tinder couldn't care less about getting rid of.
en-unannotated-08352	A great value on Monday night!
en-unannotated-08353	Service excellent
en-unannotated-08354	Burger Heroes is located on Большая Ордынка 19 and easy to miss, since it is located in the yard.
en-unannotated-08355	Very good and mindblowing food journey, top noch.
en-unannotated-08356	Ascanio of sense coberts!
en-unannotated-08357	Super tight seating and quite unfriendly to solo diners.
en-unannotated-08358	I dragged my friends here on the advice of Trip Advisor and I think the place is over rated.
en-unannotated-08359	Will defiantly do this again both in Barcelona and in any other city where "eatwith" is present.
en-unannotated-08360	She is very helpful.
en-unannotated-08361	It kept taking me back to rate it.
en-unannotated-08362	Delicious and mouthwatering.
en-unannotated-08363	Loly is so passionate about veganism.
en-unannotated-08364	We have two wonderful meals here.
en-unannotated-08365	All three were delicious!
en-unannotated-08366	If you want to live the experience of the movie (SAW)
en-unannotated-08367	This pension far exceeded my expectations.
en-unannotated-08368	Hi everyone we left Madrid early because the hotel was a building site due to renovation.
en-unannotated-08369	Nice room!
en-unannotated-08370	Lovely spacious room with large window and great design.
en-unannotated-08371	This place is the only place in Brissy I don't hesitate to give 5 stars every time.
en-unannotated-08372	My husband ordered the savoury pancakes with prosciutto, goats cheese and tomatoes which were 149 czk.
en-unannotated-08373	This is a classy restaurant with a fun atmosphere!
en-unannotated-08374	The hand-crafted rum and vodka is delicious and ever so potent.
en-unannotated-08375	I wouldn't consider myself a coffee snob by any means, but as far as coffee goes, this is my go-to in the CBD.
en-unannotated-08376	Our meal was as perfect as last time.
en-unannotated-08377	Everything is in order to welcome you.
en-unannotated-08378	Busy even on a Monday and open til...
en-unannotated-08379	It's a gin cocktail that is a bit sweet, really tasty, and has a honeycomb as garnish- what!?!?!?!
en-unannotated-08380	it doesn't get better than this outside of Italy.
en-unannotated-08381	Everything.
en-unannotated-08382	To sum it all up-GO HERE!
en-unannotated-08383	We were upgraded to a terrace room on the return trip.
en-unannotated-08384	It's hard to go wrong with Italian food in Italy but this restaurant in particular was absolutely delicious.
en-unannotated-08385	Horchata water, 3 milk desert and barbecue tacos were good as well, but "mole poblano" was spicy.
en-unannotated-08386	great dish, however, they either ran out of cherry tomatoes or skimped on it and cut up a regular tomato amidst the cherry tomatoes.
en-unannotated-08387	My fiancé and I went on a Thursday night around 8 PM and we had to wait for about 30 minutes until we could finally be seated.
en-unannotated-08388	Needs renovation of rooms and basic infrastructure (windows, bathroom fixtures) to be competitive at the five star level.
en-unannotated-08389	Dad and my husband raved about the fabulous breakfast.
en-unannotated-08390	I advise ppl to ask to stay on the refurbished floors.
en-unannotated-08391	Wow, this is a very modern-looking, stylish Hilton.
en-unannotated-08392	The food was amazing!
en-unannotated-08393	and can't forget the amazing dessert) it was all superb!
en-unannotated-08394	The menu was limited but everything they had looked delicious, we all shared lasagne some Colombian pasties and salad.
en-unannotated-08395	All food arrived hot and very tasty.
en-unannotated-08396	Again, they were simple if you think of today's food where everything has flowers and three thousand different ingredients combined in the most awkward way.
en-unannotated-08397	The pork knee is a classic and if you like tender pork meat, then there is nothing to be afraid of!
en-unannotated-08398	They were also very accommodating with our reservation.
en-unannotated-08399	I had a upgrade but I was given one at checking only after the RedKarpet representative reminded the clerk.
en-unannotated-08400	My experience was perfect for the business purpose I was there.
en-unannotated-08401	Nice Staff, super clean, nice view if you stay at VIP, VIP lounge has a great view as well.
en-unannotated-08402	It was a tiny bit tricky finding it but once you're near it's pretty well sign posted.
en-unannotated-08403	The beer were very nice too.
en-unannotated-08404	Wonderful, traditional steak house with great service.
en-unannotated-08405	I have never had goulash before Prague because I'm from the states (Colorado to be exact) but now I might move to Czech solely for this fabulous entree.
en-unannotated-08406	Bath plug in our bath got stuck so my partner had to prize it out with a nail file to empty the dirty water.
en-unannotated-08407	We were impressed by the building itself, and by the staff.
en-unannotated-08408	Came here for drinks and dinner one night and it did not disappoint!
en-unannotated-08409	I have to close the app completely to go back to my level.
en-unannotated-08410	i go there for the cappuccino, which is great.
en-unannotated-08411	I took a toast cheese with sugar oignon.
en-unannotated-08412	You can tell however that this one is agency run as the attention to detail was not there.
en-unannotated-08413	Then there's often the disappointment when you realize they look great, but are sugary and heavy - Celicioso's cupcakes are light, fluffy and delicious.
en-unannotated-08414	Both were delicious and a great start to our meal.
en-unannotated-08415	The beer was good, no doubt.
en-unannotated-08416	This is like dining in your best friend’s house that just...
en-unannotated-08417	Whoever you do don't order the basil cream cheese sauce on your burger.
en-unannotated-08418	Pre-booking in the app works really well, but it's terrible for finding drivers when you're on the go.
en-unannotated-08419	The dinner was topped off by a bit of culinary wizardry with a liquid nitrogen cooking demonstration.
en-unannotated-08420	What really made me happy about this place after coming back from Serbia where everybody smoked everywhere (inside hotel lobbies, taxis, restaurants etc) was the fact that even tho I was seating outside I wasn't bothered by cigarette smoke because the waitress made people smoke on the other side of the "street" (well not street, it's located at an alley). Bonus points in my book for that; I hate cigarette smoke on my face, specially when I'm eating!
en-unannotated-08421	Very different to the thick slabs of fatty belly that is usually found on pork belly burgers.
en-unannotated-08422	I had the grilled halibut special, hubby had the pork belly and brother had the seafood linguini- and all three dishes were PHENOMENAL!
en-unannotated-08423	Room was very modern and comfortable.
en-unannotated-08424	Have came to SS for a couple of times and tried various pintxos bar and this has become one of my favourite.
en-unannotated-08425	Friday night was super busy and service was a tad slow but everyone was friendly.
en-unannotated-08426	Reasonable prices.
en-unannotated-08427	Great location, professional helpful and courteous service.
en-unannotated-08428	It estimated the price would be 13 euros, and it's a metered ride which cost 25 instead.
en-unannotated-08429	Bed was quite hard.
en-unannotated-08430	A very friendly and thankfully bilingual staff treated us to one of the most memorable and delicious meals we had in Paris.
en-unannotated-08431	4 stars because the pintxos were nothing to write home about and we didn't feel it was baby/child friendly.
en-unannotated-08432	We walked over from Notre dame and stopped into Berthillon ice cream shop on the way.
en-unannotated-08433	We tried two different gratins and they were tasty.
en-unannotated-08434	bathroom area in the room was not kept after sufficiently (open bags of soap at the bidet and short of toilet paper)
en-unannotated-08435	Excellent location, close to Metro and all tourist locations.
en-unannotated-08436	Hotel recommended by RedKarpet Travel.
en-unannotated-08437	Very good Restaurant!
en-unannotated-08438	Vegetables looked and tasted bland and cheap.
en-unannotated-08439	1. œuf cocotte au foie gras (egg with foie gras + bread to dip - so amazeballs)
en-unannotated-08440	One of the best things I've tasted.
en-unannotated-08441	Update- Nowhere near as good anymore.
en-unannotated-08442	Tripadvisor is usually pretty reliable.
en-unannotated-08443	Plus I love this side of town.
en-unannotated-08444	We had the 28 euro tasting menu - the sea menu for me, and the land menu for my boyfriend.
en-unannotated-08445	They could not locate their luggage cart, not, wait a few minutes, - they had no idea where it was.
en-unannotated-08446	Very friendly atmosphere, very clean, close to the airport, easy access to the airport through the hotel transport.
en-unannotated-08447	It's a must go to for a drink at the least!
en-unannotated-08448	As above.
en-unannotated-08449	Ideally located on a street next to the Ramblas.
en-unannotated-08450	It was also convenient for the day trips we did - the meeting points were around the corner.
en-unannotated-08451	We will definitely stay here again.
en-unannotated-08452	The menu is completely local and there's even notes to let you know how far the beer / wine or spirit has travelled to Brisbane.
en-unannotated-08453	It is all there, flavour, texture, uniquenes, so perfect.
en-unannotated-08454	Only 5 mins walking to the Spanish Steps and many high fashion boutiques are located around that area.
en-unannotated-08455	I had an excellent stay - the room was comfortable and very well decorated and the staff members are kind and professional.
en-unannotated-08456	Surprisingly the chocolate cake was far tastier than the creme brûlée.
en-unannotated-08457	Not cheap for Bogota, but good value and wine list...
en-unannotated-08458	We stopped in here randomly one late afternoon with no reservations, no problem!
en-unannotated-08459	One of the best "pintxos" restaurants in the old part of Donosti.
en-unannotated-08460	The beer was ok but I expected more from the reviews.
en-unannotated-08461	Really enjoyed our night out.
en-unannotated-08462	Really good burger place that does not pretend to be something else (like all rest of the over-priced American themed trying-too-hard burger joints). You can order burgers from their classic menu (bulgolgi, chicken, and pork belly burgers are popular) or you can create your own burger.
en-unannotated-08463	If you are in this part of Milan, make it a point to get here....
en-unannotated-08464	Ask for him and he will make sure it's perfection.
en-unannotated-08465	They have limited seating and it is all open air.
en-unannotated-08466	Location was in walking distance to all major tourist attractions.
en-unannotated-08467	I returned on a less crowded weekday night just for the chocolate cake and a glass of red that the waitress recommended (it was excellent).
en-unannotated-08468	It was ten times better than it smelled - the butter and garlic were on point.
en-unannotated-08469	Small and stylishly decorated it exudes class and the food lives up to the decor.
en-unannotated-08470	Don't miss on your trip to Paris.
en-unannotated-08471	We got off to a bad start when the driver who was supposed to meet us at the airport, did not turn up.
en-unannotated-08472	Breakfast was basic.
en-unannotated-08473	Lots of bars to choose from and this was quite close to where we were staying.
en-unannotated-08474	Ordered the oysters and tuna tartare.
en-unannotated-08475	The corned beef is probably my only complaint.
en-unannotated-08476	Even by applying same force,aim,spin,direction along with similar cue the chances  of potting the ball varies.
en-unannotated-08477	I recently checked in at 2:00 am and Bogota was closed but the staff was there to get me checked in and in my room asap.
en-unannotated-08478	The customer service is non igsisten as when I try to find a way to get my coins back there is no one to talk with.
en-unannotated-08479	The Survey Co tucked away at 32 Burnett Lane turned out to be perfect for dinner & potentially one of the best meals we've had.
en-unannotated-08480	This has been our go to place in Prague.
en-unannotated-08481	The restaurant offers English menu.
en-unannotated-08482	My favourite restaurant yet in Italy.
en-unannotated-08483	Great venue for lunch or dinner.
en-unannotated-08484	after traveling from the states most of the day I was ready for easy cruise control and no hassles..
en-unannotated-08485	I will definitely return when back in town.
en-unannotated-08486	Mains were the hake, butternut squash soup and pork/onion meatballs.
en-unannotated-08487	A surprise menu of multiple courses, each delicious and unique.
en-unannotated-08488	The service was top notch as well.
en-unannotated-08489	Moscow has so many nice places, Bison is one of them, just good service great steaks
en-unannotated-08490	Staff were helpful and friendly.
en-unannotated-08491	It has great restaurants, nice rooms.
en-unannotated-08492	The baked brie to start was somewhere around a fiver.
en-unannotated-08493	I noticed the staff spoke several languages The food was truly excellent.
en-unannotated-08494	The risotto Milanese was amazing with the bits of sausage and the limoncello was homemade and very delicious.
en-unannotated-08495	Not to recommend.
en-unannotated-08496	dinner.
en-unannotated-08497	Service is a bit slow due to the crowds...
en-unannotated-08498	Certainly the staff were knowledgeable and clearly passionate about the...
en-unannotated-08499	Beautiful old-world charm to the hotel with incredible paintings and furniture in the lobby.
en-unannotated-08500	I would never recommend this hotel to others.
en-unannotated-08501	The rooms are a little bit dated (they feel "heavy"), but very nice especially the washrooms.
en-unannotated-08502	The personal touch and smile of the waitress and her explaining some food choices were a nice surprise....
en-unannotated-08503	Will I come back??
en-unannotated-08504	Speaking of the main.
en-unannotated-08505	OMG to die for!
en-unannotated-08506	I hope when I go to France I can be here to eat!
en-unannotated-08507	Environment was clean and fun- it's a family owned restaurant and we had two brothers working there, one looking like Schmidt from New Girl lol.
en-unannotated-08508	but they'll do their best to fit you in...
en-unannotated-08509	Usless, I wrote the above nearly 2 years ago and I installed the app recently to see if they got there act together and fixed problems I had previously, but NO not only have they not fixed it the whole thing is 10 times worse, no choice of programmes on A to Z it stays stuck on letter E and I, this app needs to be taken of play store until tv3 gets there act together, for a national broadcaster to have such a poor app is ridiculous and unfair on others who would do a better job than tv3,did I forget to mention I have sound but no picture, that is on the poor choice limited I have of Ireland am and other programmes I have no interest in watching
en-unannotated-08510	The steak was good, but I've had better in NYC.
en-unannotated-08511	After our meals we were given complimentary limoncello that was homemade by the family who runs the restaurant.
en-unannotated-08512	Great place, great food, great people!
en-unannotated-08513	Magret de Canard, Medallions de langue de boeuf confit, Poulet facon cordon bleu, sauce fois gras!
en-unannotated-08514	Definitely check it out if you're into Indie, hipster, modern style cafes and places :)
en-unannotated-08515	Try nata with your bolillo.
en-unannotated-08516	For entrees, we highly recommend the butternut pumpkin gnocchi, & moreton bay bug as well as the pan roasted coral trout with golden chicken jamon & shitake broth.
en-unannotated-08517	It's a great time killer.
en-unannotated-08518	Minor Lights not working.
en-unannotated-08519	However food was under flavoured with...
en-unannotated-08520	Ravioles de foie gras de canard a la creme de truffe | Foie gras duck ravioli in truffle cream sauce
en-unannotated-08521	I found it via amazing Yelp reviews and they did not disappoint!
en-unannotated-08522	We stopped by for lunch.
en-unannotated-08523	The chicken breast and the Prague ham is also good.
en-unannotated-08524	Excellent breakfast and location.
en-unannotated-08525	Mlejnice Garden staff is quite friendly and the ambiance is very nice.
en-unannotated-08526	I rarely give five stars but everything about L'Estrapade was fantastic.
en-unannotated-08527	Has covered seating which is mainly outdoors.
en-unannotated-08528	The dish had just the right amount to fill you up.
en-unannotated-08529	Chandeliers in room broken, bath water cold and part of bath broken - told reception nothing done - bar too small and restaurant tables to close together
en-unannotated-08530	Food was outstanding.
en-unannotated-08531	Best place to work and enjoy nice food and wine!
en-unannotated-08532	All in all I recommend spotify to everyone, I got the family plan (6 accounts for $15 a month) and I share with friends just cause its that good of a deal.
en-unannotated-08533	Normally the GF bread is horrible...
en-unannotated-08534	Amazing pizza and great service.
en-unannotated-08535	I just love this game.
en-unannotated-08536	it felt like we were an inconvenience instead of a welcome customer about to spend money.
en-unannotated-08537	We ordered the following:
en-unannotated-08538	Staff are obviously passionate about the food and are very knowledgeable about the perfect wines to accompany the food.
en-unannotated-08539	Very filling despite the quite small place and very low height chairs.
en-unannotated-08540	They also came with a little side salad with a lovely sort of vinaigrette.
en-unannotated-08541	I took a 45min taxi trip here today as I read here on tripadvisor that the restaurant had gluten free options.
en-unannotated-08542	They let you in and a giant sliding door closes behind you.
en-unannotated-08543	Perfectly sweet and alcohol-y.
en-unannotated-08544	It was way way way too fishy and towards the end the taste was just too much and we couldn't finish it.
en-unannotated-08545	We stayed 2 nights through booking.
en-unannotated-08546	My favourite sound is someone who knows how to do their job- offering everything is a clear indication that they know what's up!
en-unannotated-08547	It would have been really nice to have a few more suggestions/options for a group dining experience to make sure we were getting a good sampling of their "best ofs". So let's be honest, it was mostly hit.
en-unannotated-08548	Of course we started with two different cocktails for me (lemon & lime bitters, coke for him), I was more than surprised with the flavors.
en-unannotated-08549	- Old & very dirty shower head;
en-unannotated-08550	It gave the drink a pleasant savoury aspect.
en-unannotated-08551	The mixed ceviche is a small portion for the price 12$ but other than that everything was good
en-unannotated-08552	A really terrific small boutique hotel, with stunning huge suite-type rooms, more like an apartment than a hotel.
en-unannotated-08553	Not sure what the air-filled bread was, but it was amazing as well.
en-unannotated-08554	I came here a while back, I'm glad to finally have the time to review this restaurant!
en-unannotated-08555	You need take a bus to arrive the centre of the city (10 minutes, more or less).
en-unannotated-08556	Great service too.
en-unannotated-08557	Wine is delicious, Duck pate is amazing and my veal was so tender and great.
en-unannotated-08558	I think my best meal in Northern Spain
en-unannotated-08559	A few days ago we went with a couple of friends and we were disappointed by the quality of the food.
en-unannotated-08560	You can feel that it needs a strong whiff of renovation.
en-unannotated-08561	No place to place personal products in bathroom
en-unannotated-08562	I will really miss this restaurant after leaving Prague.
en-unannotated-08563	Great location on the Brisbane River with views of the Story Bridge.
en-unannotated-08564	A good room with balcony facing west, which was extremely hot.
en-unannotated-08565	the views, the decoration of the rooms and public areas
en-unannotated-08566	I know it lags because it's sat for a few seconds after I touched the screen.
en-unannotated-08567	We came in at around 7pm our first night in Milan.
en-unannotated-08568	Happy to see that it's run by the same management, chefs and staff though!!
en-unannotated-08569	The flavours were all spot on with the Barramundi being a standout dish.
en-unannotated-08570	First of all a lot of students are there.
en-unannotated-08571	The waiter is great the chef is great and the ambience is fantastic!
en-unannotated-08572	When we came it wasnt to crowded so we got a small table overlooking the street.
en-unannotated-08573	This is a small Taberna that's big on quality.
en-unannotated-08574	However, I have a problem with the new Soundcloud Go.
en-unannotated-08575	The lamb was good and we went back the next night and the beef filet was also good.
en-unannotated-08576	The facial recognition tech in it is so cool and also very useful!
en-unannotated-08577	A short break in this gelateria.
en-unannotated-08578	Room was really small & poorly laid out with quite worn furnishings.
en-unannotated-08579	This is the spot to come to if you're craving a hearty, home-cooked meal.
en-unannotated-08580	I feel like my review of the food won't be very helpful because I am not an adventurous person, so despite having been to Verve many times, I only have ever eaten the blue cheese risotto.
en-unannotated-08581	This is a great basic hotel if you just need a place to stay for few days.
en-unannotated-08582	Only downside?
en-unannotated-08583	My reservation was done incorrectly so I was booked at the Bogota Marriot.
en-unannotated-08584	Definitely need reservations.
en-unannotated-08585	We were seated right away and brought over Prosecco and then some fresh bread with olive oil and drenched hot peppers which gave the olive oil more flavor.
en-unannotated-08586	We are frequent visitors to Peru and therefore were looking forward to our night of ceviche!
en-unannotated-08587	Merci beaucoup!!!
en-unannotated-08588	The only part he didn't like was the rice ball, but I was happy to take that off his hands!
en-unannotated-08589	We had the pleasure of staying here for a weekend.
en-unannotated-08590	Highlight was the scampi risotto with sea urchin butter.
en-unannotated-08591	There's something to suit most tastes here, and the rotating specials are worth a look.
en-unannotated-08592	The food was very tasty and while pricy like all Australian meals, it didn't feel exorbitant.
en-unannotated-08593	5 stars for sure and I hope to come back here again sometime in my life.
en-unannotated-08594	The meat was a pretty rare (just how I like it!) and very juicy.
en-unannotated-08595	Breakfast
en-unannotated-08596	We opted to upgrade to a Reforma view room for this trip.
en-unannotated-08597	So food was splashing out when I tried to cut.
en-unannotated-08598	Everything was fresh and well prepared.
en-unannotated-08599	In the evening we sat on the chairs by the roof top pool.
en-unannotated-08600	Will definitely stay here again in the future.
en-unannotated-08601	Sword fish well cooked with herbs...
en-unannotated-08602	The nagging that accompanied my search for the entrance of Survey Co was well worth it in the end - we were greeted by a wonderful ambience and lovely staff.
en-unannotated-08603	I want to give this place 5 stars so badly, but it's so incredibly hectic.
en-unannotated-08604	Lastly, I really enjoyed the atmosphere here.
en-unannotated-08605	My husband and I spent almost a week in Mexico City at the Hampton Inn.
en-unannotated-08606	Cheers!
en-unannotated-08607	My family of 5 (3 kids under 11) enjoyed a delicious traditional French cuisine.
en-unannotated-08608	We went for lunch and dinner and regarded it as the best restaurant we dined in during our holiday in Corsica.
en-unannotated-08609	The hotel itself is so grand inside and because of a delay on check in the gentlemen graciously upgraded us to the best room we have ever stayed in Rome, complete with terrace and stunning bathroom!
en-unannotated-08610	Excellent tapas to share, fine wine, very clean and welcoming place.
en-unannotated-08611	So good for a quick bite!
en-unannotated-08612	It has been spot on.
en-unannotated-08613	everything are great.
en-unannotated-08614	What u get instead is a no-frills old school institution that serves quick and yummy bar tapas.
en-unannotated-08615	The service oh man does this place get packed, and somehow they don't screw up your order even if they are running a zillion tables.
en-unannotated-08616	Fabulous!
en-unannotated-08617	Booked a last minute room.
en-unannotated-08618	Filling, fresh, and tasty comfort food.
en-unannotated-08619	Throughout it all, I seated myself facing the kitchen, so I can see what food was coming and going, and it was heaps of fun watching them whip out plates.
en-unannotated-08620	You just have to watch the traffic in and out of this establishment to confirm its standing in the world of food!
en-unannotated-08621	We had two lovely pizzas, we were told we would have to wait 20 minutes for the pizzas to be done, in the end we'd waited 35-40 minutes...
en-unannotated-08622	The staff were fantastic , waiter jake was amazing made our experience very unique and romantic thanx jake your amazing.
en-unannotated-08623	Awesome fresh fish!
en-unannotated-08624	Nice little spot that slings some mighty fine seafood tacos.
en-unannotated-08625	You can also sub in pasta if you want to customize your entree which I found to be really accommodating (again, Italian restaurants are very particular so customizing was a nice change from the norm). We were so full by the end of our meal that we did not wanted to order dessert and for good reason also because they bring you nectarines, peanuts, all kinds of colorful candy in jars and plenty of Limencello.
en-unannotated-08626	- Staff are welcoming and friendly
en-unannotated-08627	We have stayed at Hotel Orfila during four nights of our vacation in Spain.
en-unannotated-08628	Borscht is great but everything else not so good.
en-unannotated-08629	I got a soup that was on special.
en-unannotated-08630	But be prepared for a heavy meal because it's heavy on the cream side but well worth the calories if you want a truly French experience!!
en-unannotated-08631	Was that some kind of sick joke?
en-unannotated-08632	* Pay with cash or get a relevant bank app.
en-unannotated-08633	We tried to eat it but it was just not possible.
en-unannotated-08634	This was a surprise birthday trip for my boyfriend and he was blown away - plus he fell in love with the marble stair case.
en-unannotated-08635	I read the reviews, and pulled my boyfriend down the street to give it a try!
en-unannotated-08636	My family just returned today from a four night stay at the Marriott Reforma Hotel.
en-unannotated-08637	It isn't bad.
en-unannotated-08638	This is a sure bet hotel.
en-unannotated-08639	Message service cpuld do with a tweak.
en-unannotated-08640	No lock from inside of the room door
en-unannotated-08641	Cons:  Latest issue: can't pause videos through specific apps like Hulu or Netflix, instead (pressing pause does nothing), I have to stop casting with the Home app to pause or stop videos.
en-unannotated-08642	As a vegetarian they had a great selection!
en-unannotated-08643	AMAZING!
en-unannotated-08644	Not at all overpriced for the quality of the pizza.
en-unannotated-08645	It's more dense and sweeter than the ones in the States and therefore give a more cohesive bite), the pickles/onions, and the hard-to-find high meat to bun ratio (I always find American burgers to have way too much buns/carb). By the time the sausage arrived at the table I was already stuffed and didn't eat much of it but it was delicious nonetheless.
en-unannotated-08646	Would love to...
en-unannotated-08647	Idk how to describe but it's best combination of cake and chocolate.
en-unannotated-08648	Don't play around w other restaurants.
en-unannotated-08649	We also had grilled vegetable side, do not recommend, tasted charred, no other flavour.
en-unannotated-08650	This was followed by a green leaf...
en-unannotated-08651	A great first experience and certainly won't be the last.
en-unannotated-08652	Amazing dinner.
en-unannotated-08653	Being in a more residential area rather than in tourist central makes for a much more relaxed stay.
en-unannotated-08654	Otherwise everything was perfect and wonderful staff !
en-unannotated-08655	Have problems getting taxis on this.
en-unannotated-08656	Food is really good, lots of options.
en-unannotated-08657	We had a great time in this lovely city, Hotel was great and even though it rained we had a fabulous experience.
en-unannotated-08658	Beautifully set up.
en-unannotated-08659	Try the schnitzel.
en-unannotated-08660	Just not good.
en-unannotated-08661	It isnt the place to stay at for an overhaul lunch with a business agenda, but its great for a quick snack with high quality.
en-unannotated-08662	Just because I'm no longer Yelp Elite after six years doesn't mean I don't know how to find the culinary treasures all over the world still.
en-unannotated-08663	Shockling bad.
en-unannotated-08664	they had clearly forgotten our food, long story short, after waiting an hour and a half, we got 3 out of four meals, they then had the audacity to ask if we still wanted our 4th meal.
en-unannotated-08665	Overall, great food, authentic, fun, and quick.
en-unannotated-08666	P.S If your table has a drawer, OPEN IT...
en-unannotated-08667	We will dine and refer many to your service.
en-unannotated-08668	The Box was located down a small side alley outside of the gothic quarter.
en-unannotated-08669	It's very thick, almost like a hot pudding.
en-unannotated-08670	We were greeted warmly and informed that "because everyone turned up around the same time, food could take 20 to 40 mins". Surely not...
en-unannotated-08671	My husband had the scallops and cod.
en-unannotated-08672	There was a load of prosciutto, and the cherry tomatoes were super sweet and plump (heh). The pancakes themselves were very well-executed, and the more savory ones had a little bit of crisp on them, which I tend to like.
en-unannotated-08673	The hotel staff were as friendly and helpful as ever and really made an effort to make our stay and my partner’s birthday special.
en-unannotated-08674	Total check 45.000 with 2 Club Colombia Dorada.
en-unannotated-08675	I've got to laugh at the previous review that said the owner looked like Jason Stratham, lol, because he really does (which is no bad thing) - so that's reason enough for the ladies/gays to check this place out, BUT, the food was also very...
en-unannotated-08676	After being handed a red rose, I started with a raspberry and almond collins, which was super sour (just how I like things), and made with fresh ingredients.
en-unannotated-08677	Cooked just right, the meat was tender and juicy, and the skin was very flavorful.
en-unannotated-08678	Got up and left.
en-unannotated-08679	Just shows you ads and goes back to the main screen.
en-unannotated-08680	I had the special starter, which was a crab salad with passionfruit juice.
en-unannotated-08681	This hotel is located a few kilometers way from the old part of San Sebastian where the action is, about 6-9 Euro by taxi.
en-unannotated-08682	Best part of the hotel is the outdoor atrium/courtyard.
en-unannotated-08683	A FORTUNATE WARNING THO....
en-unannotated-08684	Well presented and exciting foods that challenged traditional flavours and combinations.
en-unannotated-08685	I can't put my finger on it, but something was missing.
en-unannotated-08686	we had the 8 course tasting menu which was delicious!
en-unannotated-08687	2 weeks ago I attended the spa with my cousin.
en-unannotated-08688	I took the phone because I wanted to call the house keeping or the reception to show them what's happening the phone does not show any button on how to reach anyone and i had to go all the way down to speak to the reception and then they informed me that whenever I need anything I just need to dial the number 9 no information was giving when we came , no one took us to the rooms nothing at all .
en-unannotated-08689	I had the veal which came Ina rich buttery sauce with French fries.
en-unannotated-08690	Everything that was ordered around us looked amazing.
en-unannotated-08691	It offered a quiet retreat from the bustle of the great city and the menu selection satisfied our group's varied tastes including gluten free and vegetarian....
en-unannotated-08692	We had no room for dessert, but heard that their hot chocolate is supposed to be great.
en-unannotated-08693	Rudi and his wife are great hosts.
en-unannotated-08694	A lovely place...
en-unannotated-08695	It's specialty is fish and seafood with pasta, so be sure to indulge in some!
en-unannotated-08696	This place delivered.
en-unannotated-08697	Location could not be better.
en-unannotated-08698	I can't tell you which entrée was better because both were beyond excellent.
en-unannotated-08699	Ask for [NAME] if you want to try a dish that's new and exciting.
en-unannotated-08700	Merci !
en-unannotated-08701	Petersburg and we had a pleasant meal together.
en-unannotated-08702	This is one of the healthiest burgers I have ever tasted and perhaps that's it's downfall; grease-less, sans crispy charred bits and no condiments(aside from a few slices of pickles) whatsoever.
en-unannotated-08703	The developers have to eat too...
en-unannotated-08704	They place was packed for a Thursday night (lots of reservations and was a long wait for walk in) but since I was solo I found a place to sit at the bar.
en-unannotated-08705	Cheese, meet, cherries , spinach, apple and many many other fillings.
en-unannotated-08706	To top it all up they gave us limoncello, clementines and sweets!!
en-unannotated-08707	When we first arrived, we were a little put-off by the location and lack of main floor lobby.
en-unannotated-08708	Right in the very heart of old town San Sebastián.
en-unannotated-08709	Nothing
en-unannotated-08710	All ths food tastes absolutely delicious and has an amazing consistency, and the prices are really reasonable.
en-unannotated-08711	The service is fast making it the perfect option for a Friday lunch away from the office when you don't want to eat something from a food court.
en-unannotated-08712	Dessert, however, has got to be my favorite part.
en-unannotated-08713	I was back in Prague for a few days with my girlfriend.
en-unannotated-08714	Top notch staff !
en-unannotated-08715	The hotel had first class facilities and staff were very friendly and helpful.
en-unannotated-08716	When you sit to order and immediatly when locals on other tables recognise you are not local and...
en-unannotated-08717	The chef is a...
en-unannotated-08718	Although we missed a regular toast with ham and cheese, we liked the banana bread and chocolate cake (not a very healthy breakfast though).
en-unannotated-08719	I stayed in the hotel and on sunday all the other restaurants in town are closing very early so we tried the restaurant in the hotel, which was surprisingly good.
en-unannotated-08720	Thanks to [name], [name] and [name]!!
en-unannotated-08721	Great breakfast place in Prague.
en-unannotated-08722	The Staff was amazing!!!
en-unannotated-08723	Close to the Old Town to Charles Bridge crawl but a little bit off of it, this pub is a gem.
en-unannotated-08724	Every table around us was either occupied or reserved.
en-unannotated-08725	6, and the best way to go back and enjoy the speed and the rest of the New Jersey, 10th, so that you can be found at the University.
en-unannotated-08726	Located on one of the best family beaches on this part of the island, Cafe de la Plage serves great fresh food.
en-unannotated-08727	I and my colleagues were generally dissatisfied with this hotel and one of staff who behaved so unprofessionally.
en-unannotated-08728	Tried to reinstall keeps doing the same thing.
en-unannotated-08729	I recommend it!
en-unannotated-08730	The breakfast is very good.
en-unannotated-08731	If you like meat, this is the place!
en-unannotated-08732	- Closed terrace (meant to be a highlight);
en-unannotated-08733	Only location
en-unannotated-08734	In general not worth for the money.
en-unannotated-08735	Use of the button on the table is handy for refills of water (or more bottles of wine!)
en-unannotated-08736	And the prices; they are more expensive than other similar pubs in Dublin.
en-unannotated-08737	They put all other fries to shame!
en-unannotated-08738	Pretty weird to me.
en-unannotated-08739	Just a cafe macchiato before making my way to the museum.
en-unannotated-08740	For international travelers, note that they mostly use American plugs here.
en-unannotated-08741	Both times at 8th floor.
en-unannotated-08742	I am gobsmacked.
en-unannotated-08743	For my starter I got the warm goat cheese salad, the steak with white peppercorn sauce for my main, and the deconstructed apple pie for dessert.
en-unannotated-08744	Tom-ka, avokado salad and pumpkin patties are specially rated!
en-unannotated-08745	Bill night one €53, night two €68. We over tipped.
en-unannotated-08746	Has 'something went wrong, try again later' glitches all the time.
en-unannotated-08747	It was a joy to see  them every morning
en-unannotated-08748	And not even a bottle of water which given complimentary on arrival to all guest.
en-unannotated-08749	Stayed here for 4 nights and the room was clean, spacious and comfortable.
en-unannotated-08750	Location on main road to east of city centre, about 25 mins walk to old town.
en-unannotated-08751	The black-out blinds were fantastic.
en-unannotated-08752	A bowl of an amuse of meatballs in red gravy--here you cannot help but sop that red gravy with the bread.
en-unannotated-08753	We stayed across the street from this little wine and tapas joint.
en-unannotated-08754	Enough said.
en-unannotated-08755	The beef came with potato pancakes and cranberry sauce.
en-unannotated-08756	Modern decor;
en-unannotated-08757	Was an really heart warming experience and a great risotto.
en-unannotated-08758	The interior is minimalistic yet elegant.
en-unannotated-08759	The perfect holiday location.
en-unannotated-08760	We really enjoyed our stay in this friendly hotel.
en-unannotated-08761	The menu is obscurely written to try and communicate fancy complexity.
en-unannotated-08762	We didn't want another beer.
en-unannotated-08763	It's hard to choose standouts because it was all so good!
en-unannotated-08764	I was lucky enough to catch the early menu, which was a great price.
en-unannotated-08765	Tip: Rome is too amazing & romantic to waste any minute of a trip at this place.
en-unannotated-08766	Amazing fresh food and unbelievably friendly service.
en-unannotated-08767	I cannot begin to describe how creamy and delicious it was.
en-unannotated-08768	Great loacation for beach and shopping
en-unannotated-08769	I can not say enough about this place.
en-unannotated-08770	Or be prepared to wait for some time to get a seat at this small restaurant!!!
en-unannotated-08771	Coffee was nice
en-unannotated-08772	The end result is a smooth blend - I had the lavender dark hot chocolate.
en-unannotated-08773	Seated quickly, nice ambience.
en-unannotated-08774	Also wifi was horrible it breaks every minute and too slow.
en-unannotated-08775	Nice hotel.
en-unannotated-08776	Runs quickly.
en-unannotated-08777	My 6 year old downloaded it and I just had to get it myself after seeing him playing for do long and loving it.
en-unannotated-08778	The owners are very friendly and welcomin people.
en-unannotated-08779	Overall, lovely establishment with even lovelier food and staff.
en-unannotated-08780	The fish menu looked quite nice and a few us had the barramundi, which had a slightly floury texture, possibly due to freezing???
en-unannotated-08781	The price fix is so worth it 36Euros for a 3 course meal ....
en-unannotated-08782	Note - there is no hotel bar or restaurant - breakfast is available to order for room delivery, but we just ate out.
en-unannotated-08783	Saves time and money!!
en-unannotated-08784	It was very delightful place to eat breakfast!
en-unannotated-08785	Hotel Urban was a fantastic location for exploring Madrid.
en-unannotated-08786	Coincidentally she also competed on Top Chef and was a semi finalist.
en-unannotated-08787	Me and the BF are huge foie lovers, and everything on the menu sounded amazinggg.
en-unannotated-08788	Fine dining with a somewhat casual atmosphere.
en-unannotated-08789	Sometimes when you get daily spins or gifts from friends it doesn't pay out.
en-unannotated-08790	Was visiting Paris for the first time with my wife and decided to make the two block journey from our home away from home to L'Estrapade.
en-unannotated-08791	Velkop kozel cerny beer IS SO GOOD.
en-unannotated-08792	What makes this place even better is the lively atmosphere.
en-unannotated-08793	I had the oysters and they were as fresh as they come.
en-unannotated-08794	It is about 15 minutes to go on foot to downtown.
en-unannotated-08795	Just tried to watch a programme ..
en-unannotated-08796	Their menu had so many items on it that I wanted to try, although next time it will be hard not to go for THAT AMAZING BURGER again.
en-unannotated-08797	Solving them im under 15 seconds would be a nice touch.
en-unannotated-08798	They were so very accurate.
en-unannotated-08799	I mostly utilise Brew for take-away coffee on the way to work, though I've had evening drinks here as well, and it's been just as great each visit.
en-unannotated-08800	Room was lovely, as was the patio out back; ambiance was delightful, and breakfast was good (albeit expensive). The staff are tremendous - polite, friendly, extremely helpful.
en-unannotated-08801	There's plenty of cozy booths too.
en-unannotated-08802	Booking.
en-unannotated-08803	:-)
en-unannotated-08804	Food wasn't as great as everyone pointed it out.
en-unannotated-08805	Everything worked well together.
en-unannotated-08806	WELL...
en-unannotated-08807	An historical building with glamorous look.
en-unannotated-08808	The starter was spot on, the main course was so flavoursome.
en-unannotated-08809	There are specific dishes that truly make this place a hidden gem, whereas there are also some dishes that you should skip out on.
en-unannotated-08810	Every time I click on close all applications on my gal s8 it stops playing.
en-unannotated-08811	It was a little rainy while we were there so we found other things to do.
en-unannotated-08812	One last trip found me eating the steak tartare which was excellent.
en-unannotated-08813	The location is very quiet and the view from rooms 308 or 309 cant be beat.
en-unannotated-08814	This is a well run hotel with a low key atmosphere, very attractive and comfortable.
en-unannotated-08815	The chips here is rather thin, look like the McDonald ones than the normal thick, finger-looking restaurant chips.
en-unannotated-08816	This place is practically the poster café for the Look at this F*cking Hipster website.
en-unannotated-08817	Shepherd's pie - amazing
en-unannotated-08818	If you like seafood that is the perfect spot to get very good mejillon !
en-unannotated-08819	At first, it seemed to be a sit down coffee house with desserts, but the menu showed there was a greater selection of food available.
en-unannotated-08820	We also got the...
en-unannotated-08821	[name] Was very attentive and helpful.
en-unannotated-08822	We were a party of 4 and everyone ordered the fixed meñu that costs 3,200 Rubles each and an extra side salad.
en-unannotated-08823	We are very disappointed with the bathroom.
en-unannotated-08824	I ordered off the lunch menu and decided on the proper fish pie which included Hegarty's cheddar, mesculan salad and farmhouse brown bread.
en-unannotated-08825	The one thing that was a pain
en-unannotated-08826	Brilliant and reasonable prices 40 Euro for two medium sizes and a beer each (medium...
en-unannotated-08827	The best schnitzel I had throughout my 4 months in Europe (step up your game, Germany). The fried coating was flavorful but not too salty or oily, and the mashed potatoes beneath the meat were so warm and hearty.
en-unannotated-08828	My husband and I have talked about visiting this restaurant many times.
en-unannotated-08829	Laughed a lot and will definitely come back!
en-unannotated-08830	Not close to any metro station.
en-unannotated-08831	This place is a hidden gem!
en-unannotated-08832	The hot water in the shower was only warm.
en-unannotated-08833	A great set of food came our way and aced it all the way.
en-unannotated-08834	But my expectations were highly exceeded.
en-unannotated-08835	We booked Hotel Preciados at the last minute with minimum research on Trip Advisor and really lucked out.
en-unannotated-08836	The dish was creamy and I found myself scraping for the last pieces of risotto on the dish!
en-unannotated-08837	They serve locally sourced Vermouth with local Catalan dishes.
en-unannotated-08838	I ended up settling on the smashed avocado on ciabatta with a side of bacon (bit of a bacon fan) which did not disappoint.
en-unannotated-08839	Both nights we dined here, the service was good.
en-unannotated-08840	She apologised and investigated, claiming the printer had not printed out docket, she offered us complimentary drinks and our food arrived quickly.
en-unannotated-08841	This was my 4th stay at the JW Bogota.
en-unannotated-08842	Disappointing considering the price.
en-unannotated-08843	Jellyfish Restaurant has excellent seafood and friendly service.
en-unannotated-08844	Nice early bird menu and attentive service.
en-unannotated-08845	room facilities pretty basic - minibar only soft drink, in room dining choices very basic, geberal lack of atmosphere in the hotel,
en-unannotated-08846	Fix this soon and I might change my rating.
en-unannotated-08847	Very quaint place.
en-unannotated-08848	Staff very friendly and rooms, although aging, were clean and tidy.
en-unannotated-08849	Cute space, nice staff, and quick service.
en-unannotated-08850	The food at Le Comptoir De La Gastronome certainly is more towards the refined end of scale, yet is very reasonably priced and well proportioned in serving size.
en-unannotated-08851	(I also noticed that Survey Co has a coat rack at the entrance - perhaps instead of encouraging diners to place theirs there, they could have some to hire out for the evening?)
en-unannotated-08852	Considering most of the entrees are 15 euro+, its a good deal if you want a salad or starter.
en-unannotated-08853	This is a major cause of stress when I do not reply to time sensitive with emails because I have no idea I have received them!!
en-unannotated-08854	If you want to go without a reservation make sure you go early!
en-unannotated-08855	The Faudant au Chocolat was like a chocolate lava cake and we had to beg my 8yr old some to let us at least try a taste of it.
en-unannotated-08856	Portions are not huge but enough to feel good after eating.
en-unannotated-08857	The espresso drinks were delicious!
en-unannotated-08858	I think I ate every last crumb of each dish that was put in front of me.
en-unannotated-08859	We sat outside with our tacos and beers.
en-unannotated-08860	Overall hideous experience
en-unannotated-08861	This has got to be one of best hidden gems to be found in Milan.
en-unannotated-08862	Accepts all major credit cards
en-unannotated-08863	They go above and beyond by providing you with a Samsung Smartphone that is free to use across the city for internet to buy tickets, find restaurants, use the internet.
en-unannotated-08864	1. Smoking Indoors and Seating.
en-unannotated-08865	Restaurant service was outstanding.
en-unannotated-08866	The facilities and staff were excellent.
en-unannotated-08867	Brilliant for an early morning walk before the crowds descend.
en-unannotated-08868	We had a "signoret" and "black rice" paellas with a nice jar of sangría.
en-unannotated-08869	The cookie was disappointingly dry and essentially flavorless.
en-unannotated-08870	Service and attention from personnel is excellent.
en-unannotated-08871	We had a lovely dinner, his moules were with traditional sauce and...
en-unannotated-08872	And the food was absolutely incredible and shockingly inexpensive.
en-unannotated-08873	and before we knew it, our hour had passed.
en-unannotated-08874	Super sweet- but delicious!
en-unannotated-08875	I found each dish perfectly balanced.
en-unannotated-08876	I noticed that every table in the hall had one also.
en-unannotated-08877	Hope to try some other things in the next few days....
en-unannotated-08878	I decided to get the smoked salmon pancakes, BF got the prosciutto ones.
en-unannotated-08879	Definitely one of my favorites!
en-unannotated-08880	Getting there just before noon is best to avoid the long-lines.
en-unannotated-08881	This place is known for its risotto and boy it was amazing.
en-unannotated-08882	Cute room.
en-unannotated-08883	Location perfect for us because it meant we got to see more of the local side of Rome and not just the obvious tourist spots.
en-unannotated-08884	The rooms lack basic facilities such as tea and coffee making facilities and a hairdryer that actually dries your hair.
en-unannotated-08885	Just try to learn some French and say please and thank you.
en-unannotated-08886	Punch it up a bit.
en-unannotated-08887	Epicure is deserved to receive the 3*. I will point out that the google map information is somewhat wrong.
en-unannotated-08888	But to be honest, they were all REALLY good!
en-unannotated-08889	Broken lights
en-unannotated-08890	This new hotel is great value, in the fancy neighborhood of Madrid, and walking distance to all the hot spots.
en-unannotated-08891	Will definitely go there again.
en-unannotated-08892	We started the meal with a glass of champagne, and ordered the Chervre Frais (fresh, warm goat cheese) and the Terrine de Canard (Duck Pate). Both were excellent choices with the warm fresh bread.
en-unannotated-08893	complete waste of time just like the tv3 channel
en-unannotated-08894	Simple, rustic environment.
en-unannotated-08895	As the hotel is brand new  some points should be improved : few TV channels available, no garbage Trash in the bathroom, no holders for soap and shower diffuser.
en-unannotated-08896	Reasonable value for money.
en-unannotated-08897	What an experience, JY's passion,presentation,taste buds still experiencing what they never had,a surprising wonderful social event from all over the world.
en-unannotated-08898	great view over the bay...
en-unannotated-08899	Cafeteria Quality
en-unannotated-08900	The food, the service and the ambiance.
en-unannotated-08901	Go have a drink on the steps of Sacre Coeur, marvel at the beauty of Paris, then indulge yourself in this wonderful restaurant.
en-unannotated-08902	The Mercure Monte Igueldo has a world-class view, but very little else to recommend it.
en-unannotated-08903	brewery restaurant on river Vlatava that offers world class micro-brews and gastro-fare at an incredible price backed with 5-star service and old world charm..
en-unannotated-08904	I had the jumbo house steak which was cooked to perfection.
en-unannotated-08905	The service is perfect and the waiter translated the menu for us and gave us all the service needed.
en-unannotated-08906	Just thicker.
en-unannotated-08907	Cappuccino was very, very strong.
en-unannotated-08908	Very close to the cathedral.
en-unannotated-08909	The burger was big and full of flavor.
en-unannotated-08910	Adequate in all ways and an excellent value.
en-unannotated-08911	We then found out that the entire place was booked w/ reservations beginning at...
en-unannotated-08912	This was the best meal we had in Paris, in my opinion.
en-unannotated-08913	Location of the hotel is excellent.
en-unannotated-08914	another bonus is its close to where I live - happy days!
en-unannotated-08915	Solid coffee and great food.
en-unannotated-08916	However, our server recommended a few items from the menu.
en-unannotated-08917	The staff was very friendly and helpful.
en-unannotated-08918	Usually I stay at JW Marriot in Bogota.
en-unannotated-08919	They make every plate to order, and they pair them really well with fresh fruit and sauces, it makes a really good brekkie.
en-unannotated-08920	Great and fresh King pawns!
en-unannotated-08921	I came to San Sebastián to visit my daughter.
en-unannotated-08922	Several servers running around collecting plates.
en-unannotated-08923	The gratin came out hot and smelled divine.
en-unannotated-08924	The taste of meat, variety of drinks .....
en-unannotated-08925	Delicious lunch spot!
en-unannotated-08926	Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, perfect location.
en-unannotated-08927	And the service.
en-unannotated-08928	If u r shifting from one mi Redmi phn to another than scores and levels gets transferred to the new one through the in built mi mover app.
en-unannotated-08929	They both come with bread on the side.
en-unannotated-08930	Free car parking available.
en-unannotated-08931	I must say it was totally underwhelming and very disappointing.
en-unannotated-08932	Once you try it, there is no way back.
en-unannotated-08933	For a cider house, they had only TWO ciders available, according to our waitress.
en-unannotated-08934	Streetnoise from  time to time during the night.
en-unannotated-08935	I really loved the atmosphere, food, and cider!
en-unannotated-08936	Excellent location, very busy in the afternoons, but walking distance from the main sights.
en-unannotated-08937	Modern Japanese cuisine.
en-unannotated-08938	We will not be back.
en-unannotated-08939	One walk down the stairs and we returned to an abusive letter on the door from the neighbors.
en-unannotated-08940	They were quite gracious also when I learned the difference between the word "tagliere" meaning cutting board (in this case, one full of a bountiful assortment of meat for several people as a starter, and the word taglietelli, a type/shape of pasta.
en-unannotated-08941	Location
en-unannotated-08942	Everything is within walking distance.
en-unannotated-08943	Food was healthy and amazing and the cherry on the cake is that the staff are so so friendly.
en-unannotated-08944	A Distraction in a good way
en-unannotated-08945	The cafeteria on first floor had simple, but good breakfast (did not try the buffet). It was also clean.
en-unannotated-08946	Another night was charged for arrival time 11.45 a.m.
en-unannotated-08947	Fresh and delicate but it didn't hold a candle next to the soup.
en-unannotated-08948	If you're looking for an unforgettable meal in Paris that'll knock your socks off, this is your place!
en-unannotated-08949	Rich, dark, with whipped cream, it is an experience not just a meal.
en-unannotated-08950	Combined with the freshest of tomatoes and lettuce varietals, this dish is one for the memory books.
en-unannotated-08951	Our original room wasn't available so we were "upgraded" to a suite that overlooked the main square.
en-unannotated-08952	plus if you're going to serve heavy and salty meat dishes, you should at least provide some tap water to wash it down with.
en-unannotated-08953	Tried this based on the yelp reviews which I can confirm.
en-unannotated-08954	2.5 kilometers from the old town area.
en-unannotated-08955	I skipped a main in order to have dessert and wasn't sorry - their chocolate mousse is dark and decadent and served with crunch toffee cookies.
en-unannotated-08956	It was easy to get a reservation as I booked it for a Monday evening (not sure if that matters in Milan, but I feel like in the States weekends are usually busier, so I applied the same logic). We arrived 10 or 15 minutes before our reservation time and they were still kind enough to seat us.
en-unannotated-08957	Our last night
en-unannotated-08958	Just right.
en-unannotated-08959	Location was great.
en-unannotated-08960	I didn't have the opportunity to try all the restaurants in Propriano, but surely Terra Cotta must be one of the top restaurants.
en-unannotated-08961	And they were right.
en-unannotated-08962	Like Jesus Christ!
en-unannotated-08963	A beautiful balance of flavour, spice & texture.
en-unannotated-08964	Like he used to make it.
en-unannotated-08965	The baked scallops were pretty good but the caprese was below okay.
en-unannotated-08966	Although I'm not certain if all those farmer-objects fit the place, they did give you that 'authentic' feels.
en-unannotated-08967	We went there for a dinner with our friends.
en-unannotated-08968	The place is very close to a lot of the touristy areas in Prague, yet it wasn't brimming with people, so just get there on the earlier side (before 10), and you should be able to get a seat.
en-unannotated-08969	Very dark, can hardly see my friends face as we're talking!
en-unannotated-08970	I felt bad ordering just a plate of salad with grilled shrimp as it was late...
en-unannotated-08971	
en-unannotated-08972	We were greeted by the owners (husband and wife) a stylish older couple in full 1940-50s clothes (but not cheesy, really stylish aka Italian) they don't know a lot of English but were patient an understanding, wonderful people.
en-unannotated-08973	Maple pecan + espresso?
en-unannotated-08974	I had the impression this place must make really good foie gras dishes since they specialize in it.
en-unannotated-08975	So much for trying to eat a non-starchy vegetable in Eastern Europe.
en-unannotated-08976	Ok - this place is fantastic.
en-unannotated-08977	A nice dish nonetheless.
en-unannotated-08978	You can already tell by the reviews on Yelp that Den Noc is the bees knees but I had to try these delicious pancakes for myself.
en-unannotated-08979	While being my third day visiting Dublin before I venture to other areas of Ireland, I made sure I stopped at Temple Bar.
en-unannotated-08980	I had been teetering around with several other options, so I will need to come back.
en-unannotated-08981	To top it off this restaurant was super cute-tiny with about 15 seats total.
en-unannotated-08982	Good seafood, but far out, overpriced.
en-unannotated-08983	Service was prompt but not too formal.
en-unannotated-08984	We got a table on the second floor and had THEE BEST EVER onion rings.
en-unannotated-08985	It's really only 0 star hotel.
en-unannotated-08986	I was immediately taken aback by the iron gates.
en-unannotated-08987	You could make up a challenge like can you go 10 or 20 levels without a hint.
en-unannotated-08988	my favorite restaurant in Milan!
en-unannotated-08989	I would get it again.
en-unannotated-08990	I prep the day and served more that 300 people, we are all on the same business here basically and I would not treat a costumer like that, even at the last minute.
en-unannotated-08991	This sucks because the app seemed really cool and I loved the emojis and cool stuff for pics.
en-unannotated-08992	There were a lot of really appealing vegetarian options, which is a nice change when it comes to fancy riverside dining.
en-unannotated-08993	I am so glad I found this restaurant.
en-unannotated-08994	In restroom the tile was busted in two places
en-unannotated-08995	The bedroom was clean.
en-unannotated-08996	The burrata appetizer is a particular standout - I don't think I've ever eaten burrata that good in my entire life, and I eat it very regularly.
en-unannotated-08997	To be honest, I don't get why this game gets such a bad wrap.
en-unannotated-08998	The room didn't accommodate the simplest of things that any hotel room should have like a pen, iron & the telephone didn't connect to room service.
en-unannotated-08999	The fish tacos and the shrimp tacos are delicious!
en-unannotated-09000	We also ordered a wine with the waiter's recommendation - it was excellent and not terribly expensive.
en-unannotated-09001	Basically, go here, won't regret it.
en-unannotated-09002	All this is achieved by ordering the experimental menu containing two starters, middle courses, four hot dishes and two desserts.
en-unannotated-09003	Just order beers and the giant meat, cheese and bread board and sit back and take in the atmosphere.
en-unannotated-09004	my coin gone but that table doesn't appear.
en-unannotated-09005	The bread we had for appetiser hard as a rock, inedible.
en-unannotated-09006	Even the potato with a nice cheese sauce tasted so good.
en-unannotated-09007	It's only shows a few adds and  stops loading adds when using filters
en-unannotated-09008	You won't be disappointed.
en-unannotated-09009	I had the venison pie...
en-unannotated-09010	5/5 without a doubt.
en-unannotated-09011	We went to this place two nights in a row.
en-unannotated-09012	I'd definitely go back.
en-unannotated-09013	restaurants and much more.
en-unannotated-09014	My only problem is that at some point it just goes off all by it self and it is hard to control sometimes.
en-unannotated-09015	The sauces are amazing, all house made.
en-unannotated-09016	We ended up ordering several dishes.
en-unannotated-09017	But once I'm done my first meal, I believe I fell in love with it.
en-unannotated-09018	No AC
en-unannotated-09019	The location was great, the Wi-Fi was good, towels and toiletries were great, comfy bed.
en-unannotated-09020	The overall flavour combination of the dish was fantastic with the spiced pulled pork contrasted by the creamy potato and bed of what could be described as refried black beans.
en-unannotated-09021	We then...
en-unannotated-09022	Bedroom lighting similar.
en-unannotated-09023	We had an elderly gentleman help us out too with our orders, and he was so sweet, constantly giving us snacks and shots of limoncello on the house.
en-unannotated-09024	We did the tasting menu, which I highly recommend.
en-unannotated-09025	Bites that require you to blow on it lightly so you won't burn your tongue.
en-unannotated-09026	- All the photos posted on booking website do not depict the reality.
en-unannotated-09027	Quality breakfast.
en-unannotated-09028	On the phone you can even turn on a hotspot for 5€ per day to connect other devices to it while you're out and about.
en-unannotated-09029	the pasta was cooked nicely Al dente.
en-unannotated-09030	2. Burrata with heirloom tomatoes, light subtly sweet ketchup, and crushed hazelnuts.
en-unannotated-09031	Our waiter wasn't friendly at all but luckily towards the end of the meal we got served by someone else who was smiling and made us feel welcome.
en-unannotated-09032	The servers had great knowledge about the dishes and different wines.
en-unannotated-09033	We ordered the ox burger and a fish dish, as well as ricotta cheesecake for...
en-unannotated-09034	It is still very quiet.
en-unannotated-09035	Definitely should go!!!
en-unannotated-09036	Holy shiitake mushrooms!
en-unannotated-09037	This was our first trip to Italy and our hotel stay was ruined by incompetence and lack of customer service.
en-unannotated-09038	It's probably fitting then, as Charles Burnett, who was a surveyor & explorer, is where the name The Survey Co comes from.
en-unannotated-09039	The location
en-unannotated-09040	Reasonable prices.
en-unannotated-09041	Hotel is old, expensive and needs refurbishing.
en-unannotated-09042	Every time a menu featured escargots, we ordered them lol.
en-unannotated-09043	We had the cassolette de turbon, foie gras, entrecote de boeuf poele, and the fondant au chocolat.
en-unannotated-09044	Very close to the beach with nice view over the bay if you are in 2 upper floors.
en-unannotated-09045	They also have drinks from Vietnam which makes it a cool allround experience.
en-unannotated-09046	Overall a good hotel, with a somewhat special hotel entrance via a mini shopping mall.
en-unannotated-09047	If someone had told me there was a chill, chic, hipster-esque restaurant right in Queen St Mall, before today I would have questioned that person's sanity.
en-unannotated-09048	Service is really nice and after she highly recommended the chocolate tarte to our neighbors and we saw what it looked like, we had to order one as well!
en-unannotated-09049	Soup was rich and creamy, the hake cooked perfectly and the meatballs juicy.
en-unannotated-09050	The hotel is apparently new and one can see their enthusiasm.
en-unannotated-09051	ASTOR was the best restaurant in the whole trip, food and service were astonishing!!
en-unannotated-09052	I loved the attentive service provided by the staff as well.
en-unannotated-09053	great vibe at this small joint in an upcoming neighborhood of Paris.
en-unannotated-09054	Congratulations
en-unannotated-09055	Excellent service with some difficulty with English speak guests.
en-unannotated-09056	We ate like 8 tapas and glass of wine......
en-unannotated-09057	Ordered wheat pasta and cured beef to share.
en-unannotated-09058	Almost like a baked potato, but without the skin.
en-unannotated-09059	Its a must go restaurant!
en-unannotated-09060	I got the Boxty Tasting Platter, one of the few really affordable things on the menu due to Temple Bar inflation here, and enjoyed every potatoey bite.
en-unannotated-09061	Hands down the best app and way to keep up with my business on the go!
en-unannotated-09062	The service was excellent.
en-unannotated-09063	Staff is very friendly and the rooms are really nice.
en-unannotated-09064	Service is very rudimentary.
en-unannotated-09065	Lots of dining options around the area, Parque de la 93 is at walking distance from here and its beautiful to enjoy day or night.
en-unannotated-09066	Maybe the ability to compare items or the showing of similar items...
en-unannotated-09067	With this restaurant, it was not the case.
en-unannotated-09068	Continually cold.
en-unannotated-09069	We had the duck which was fantastic.
en-unannotated-09070	The horseradish was alright, not strong enough in my opinion, as was the the mustard, but overall this was an amazing meal that I wish I could have again.
en-unannotated-09071	I'm sure coffee is great but as a destination bar it was a bit underwhelming.
en-unannotated-09072	In every detail we could feel and see how caring...
en-unannotated-09073	One line is straight to the cash register where you order food you want prepared and the other line is for the butcher of you want to buy just meat.
en-unannotated-09074	...great service and kindness from the entire crew make you feel like being at home, all the rest, position, beautiful room, great food were nice optionals...
en-unannotated-09075	If I could give this place 6*'s I would.
en-unannotated-09076	The location is perfect!
en-unannotated-09077	Lots of parking and all the staff were brilliant.
en-unannotated-09078	Staff was friendly and helpful.
en-unannotated-09079	Best enchiladas of my life.
en-unannotated-09080	Lots of personality and they make everything from scratch.
en-unannotated-09081	Terrible customer service for an app that was fairly good when it worked.
en-unannotated-09082	Last Sunday I made a reservation for brunch at La Ventana.
en-unannotated-09083	The side were yummy especially the Asian greens and the salad had a delightful fetta like dressing.
en-unannotated-09084	I order the spaghetti and it was bad.
en-unannotated-09085	Definitely recommend you stop by!!!
en-unannotated-09086	One of the staff was playing some kind of game with sound on at the reception desk.
en-unannotated-09087	I was excited to try some local cuisine and made an effort to get over to Boxty House for some boxty pancakes.
en-unannotated-09088	Very close to La Gran Via and Fuencarral street, which is great for shopping.
en-unannotated-09089	It will do this 10+ times.
en-unannotated-09090	After I booked and payed I was told it had been double booked.
en-unannotated-09091	I would totally be back.
en-unannotated-09092	This place will make your day.
en-unannotated-09093	Entrée: Oysters with a light french cider vinegar, red onion/shallot and lime - Wow they were delicious.
en-unannotated-09094	Wrong.
en-unannotated-09095	Instead we had a millefeuille that was perfect in all aspects.
en-unannotated-09096	Slight nitpick, the dish probably should be named as crab croquettes rather than crab cakes, but I digress.
en-unannotated-09097	Tried again the next day for lunch and there were tables available.
en-unannotated-09098	I started off with an appetizer - pumpkin soup.
en-unannotated-09099	Rooms are quite spacious and vey comfortable.
en-unannotated-09100	It had been many years since I went to a restaurant like this one.
en-unannotated-09101	We were locked inside the apparent because there was a failure in the lock mechanism, but were rescued by Simon very shortly.
en-unannotated-09102	Although this was my first dinner dining spot in Milan, I can confidently say that the combination of great food, a great cozy atmosphere, and kind service gives me the desire to want to come back again.
en-unannotated-09103	The pancakes are light and fluffy!
en-unannotated-09104	). The waitstaff...
en-unannotated-09105	You do need to flag down the woman and go up to the bar to pay.
en-unannotated-09106	They are often offering free samples, and the staff are helpful and friendly.
en-unannotated-09107	I loved it .
en-unannotated-09108	Wonderful.
en-unannotated-09109	Anyone on their suit & tie s**t would fit right in here amongst the sleek, streamlined, polished decor and dim lighting.
en-unannotated-09110	Best to get wine, appitizers and desserts on top of your entre.
en-unannotated-09111	It was good service without a stick up its....
en-unannotated-09112	I can recommend the carpaccio, the Black-Angus Steak and the homemade tiramisu.
en-unannotated-09113	Chicken was very tender with a light cream sauce.
en-unannotated-09114	Very good ice cream, good qualità! A bit too soft and they should use more milk than water.
en-unannotated-09115	Our luxury apartment #001 was located on the top 6th floor.
en-unannotated-09116	We sat upstairs in the balcony and it was all decorated beautifully.
en-unannotated-09117	Overall, an incredible Parisian food experience.
en-unannotated-09118	There were radishes with salt on the table.
en-unannotated-09119	We had the traditionell menue - it was very innovative and experimentell as well.
en-unannotated-09120	Overall, the restaurant's farm-friendly and homegrown, yet sophisticated Irish dishes were perfectly satisfying and did not disappoint!
en-unannotated-09121	Try the mashed with truffles!
en-unannotated-09122	Took a long time to make a custom pokè bowl which I felt could have been made up in front of me as I was choosing the ingredients.
en-unannotated-09123	I am very disappointed with you, and maybe I am not important and just another one, but I will not come back soon to your place!
en-unannotated-09124	Place gets crowded with locals after 8pm so be sure to make reservations-- which is very easy to do via their website.
en-unannotated-09125	Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable.
en-unannotated-09126	It had such great flavors and when you add it to the fried bread and eat it together...
en-unannotated-09127	It's...
en-unannotated-09128	A piano (I'd love to hear it used).
en-unannotated-09129	The most amazing breakfast!
en-unannotated-09130	The hotel was nice and clean and close to everything.
en-unannotated-09131	Le Temps des Cerises is a genuine French restaurant with incredible food & very good service.
en-unannotated-09132	Chef Hugo could not have been more accommodating.
en-unannotated-09133	It can get quite busy here and sometimes you may have to share a table.
en-unannotated-09134	Her services were provided without cost.
en-unannotated-09135	Not very far from the old town and close to other central parts of Donostia center.
en-unannotated-09136	This application is simply broken.
en-unannotated-09137	Had a 3 courses business lunch plus glass of red wine and it was exquisite.
en-unannotated-09138	This is still my fave photo app of all time on Android!
en-unannotated-09139	By far the best restaurant, both for food and ambience, during my visit here in Milan.
en-unannotated-09140	Food was ok, the one thing I liked was the good amount of vegetable with dishes.
en-unannotated-09141	hopefully will visit again
en-unannotated-09142	Extremely good and elegant food comming in a nice flow with a lot of small and very tasy tishes.
en-unannotated-09143	let's be real.
en-unannotated-09144	The location is fantastic.
en-unannotated-09145	Nice service and very delicious desserts.
en-unannotated-09146	This app crashes for some reason when I go into an app like ibispaint X.
en-unannotated-09147	If you could only experience one meal in Paris, this would have to be it!
en-unannotated-09148	Everything is fresh and home made.
en-unannotated-09149	Continental breakfast so so.
en-unannotated-09150	The restaurant is located on a very pleasant street of Brera with loads of restaurants.
en-unannotated-09151	(I know).
en-unannotated-09152	It wasn't a busy hour so most of the tables seemed open.
en-unannotated-09153	Had a wonderful 5 day stay in this modern, clean new hotel.
en-unannotated-09154	I was informed that the restaurant was...
en-unannotated-09155	I found it to be a wonderful hotel- clean, modern, comfortable, well equipped, with friendly and hard working staff.
en-unannotated-09156	Side note: apparently a lot of restaurants in Prague require reservations or they will refuse to give you a table.
en-unannotated-09157	The sauce went very well with the meat and the vegetable mix on the plate.
en-unannotated-09158	Very private and secure!
en-unannotated-09159	5 stars!
en-unannotated-09160	Utterly horrendous!
en-unannotated-09161	The hubby and I had never tried crepes before and decided to give Midi12 a go.
en-unannotated-09162	The...
en-unannotated-09163	Excellent location.
en-unannotated-09164	THE RISOTTO.
en-unannotated-09165	We watched the bar staff attend to drink orders with meticulous care.
en-unannotated-09166	And it's even worse because now I need the new subscription to listen to some songs that I want to listen to.
en-unannotated-09167	It is not particularly large and as is the case in many of these pinxtos bars, it is mainly standing only.
en-unannotated-09168	I have played it continued 4 hour, and it is really fun,  but it can be more entertaining if you guys add audio on it.
en-unannotated-09169	The lunch came out to a little over 20 euros and I went with the server's excellent recommendations.
en-unannotated-09170	One of the most enjoyable eating experiences.
en-unannotated-09171	The hotel is new with refurbishment on-going.
en-unannotated-09172	Beds were very comfortable.
en-unannotated-09173	I have a positive feeling from the night and I'd like to go back, the spaghettini looked devine!!
en-unannotated-09174	The new room was OK.
en-unannotated-09175	Rooms need an upgrade.
en-unannotated-09176	This hotel is very well located just 50m to Metro.
en-unannotated-09177	The worst "italian" pizza I have ever had!
en-unannotated-09178	The restaurant is a FIVE WOW !
en-unannotated-09179	The crèpe was massive and tasty.
en-unannotated-09180	atmosphere was pleasant and staff friendly and helpful.
en-unannotated-09181	The food is also very good.
en-unannotated-09182	Gym could be better equipped.
en-unannotated-09183	Perfect location, close to many lovely cafes and restaurants.
en-unannotated-09184	I'm delighted to say that we enjoyed everything.
en-unannotated-09185	Definitely recommended
en-unannotated-09186	He had the empty plate before it hit the table.
en-unannotated-09187	We stopped by for a quick coffee before exploring the city.
en-unannotated-09188	I tried the boxty sampler which included fried boxty pancake strips/fries, a Irish "gnocchi" if you will and a potato like bread.
en-unannotated-09189	I cannot recommend this restaurant.
en-unannotated-09190	And the haloumi and veggie skewers.
en-unannotated-09191	Very good food and the service was perfect.
en-unannotated-09192	Dafuq
en-unannotated-09193	This small place on the hilltop next to La concha is quite place to stay.
en-unannotated-09194	A must do for Barcelona!
en-unannotated-09195	Definitely worth a stop to the "Oldest Pub in Ireland" for a drink at least and some solid pub food...
en-unannotated-09196	Be sure to try the hotel restaurant - outstanding!
en-unannotated-09197	Good rooms, great meals, great service.
en-unannotated-09198	My husband ordered the duck breast, croquettes and a mixed salad.
en-unannotated-09199	Huuuge disappointment!
en-unannotated-09200	HIGHLY recommend.
en-unannotated-09201	You get free chips and salsa when seated.
en-unannotated-09202	Open kitchen, good food and nice ambiance.
en-unannotated-09203	I recommend it if you like to feel somewhere else beside where you are!!!
en-unannotated-09204	It's got great graphics and good gameplay (for a one tap game). But much like all the other complaints, it's $10 damn dollars.
en-unannotated-09205	Excellent for a weekend brunch!
en-unannotated-09206	Hopefully they get over their teething issues.
en-unannotated-09207	Compare it to something else?
en-unannotated-09208	I have also always appreciated the regularly rotating artworks by local artists that are displayed on the walls.
en-unannotated-09209	I really don't even know what I was eating.
en-unannotated-09210	Staff very courteous and helpful.
en-unannotated-09211	Inside the hotel there is free wifi.
en-unannotated-09212	You get a very warm welcome and a regional cava.
en-unannotated-09213	A pretty long bar.
en-unannotated-09214	No.
en-unannotated-09215	Brew has a brunch/grazing menu from early AM to 3pm and a tapas type menu for the PM - get the sliders people!
en-unannotated-09216	Stellar staff!
en-unannotated-09217	Jellyfish offers a nice place to eat with a wonderful view and serves well prepared fish dishes.
en-unannotated-09218	It was by far the best breakfast I've had in a while.
en-unannotated-09219	First of all Service was very poor our waitress didn't know the menue, didn't have the wine we wanted from the...
en-unannotated-09220	Location can't be bet for shopping and sightseeing.
en-unannotated-09221	The steaks looked well cooked, although quite plain as expected, and both men said that the salad was actually quite substantial so they didn't feel the need for a side.
en-unannotated-09222	A cozy cafe inside a library which offers the greatest italian coffee you can find in Moscow!
en-unannotated-09223	You would have to walk to that coffee place.
en-unannotated-09224	I also thought the service was excellent.
en-unannotated-09225	Like staying at the home of an elegant friend.
en-unannotated-09226	Dinner was the cheese and potato gratin with smoked duck breast for me, and the duck breast with the sauce of the day for him.
en-unannotated-09227	Bad A/C.
en-unannotated-09228	A good place to try Russian cuisine, but for me it was expensive.
en-unannotated-09229	Best.
en-unannotated-09230	Where has that been all my life.
en-unannotated-09231	No complimentary water
en-unannotated-09232	Highly recommended, and I hope Hugo will be around for a long time.
en-unannotated-09233	Many times you had to ask for towels as some were not left in the rooms.
en-unannotated-09234	If you are a vegetarian and live or work in Candelaria and looking for good vegetarian options, DON'T MISS THIS PLACE!
en-unannotated-09235	It was clean and nicely furnished.
en-unannotated-09236	They specialize in potatoes: the boxty is a potato pancake and then wrapped around various meats or veggies.
en-unannotated-09237	Wish we could say the same about the sausage trio (3/5) and meatloaf (3.5/5). The sausages were nothing special.
en-unannotated-09238	When we made the reservation in the afternoon the waitress was very nice!
en-unannotated-09239	Slither.
en-unannotated-09240	Black Pudding to start and steak for main course for me...
en-unannotated-09241	Littlle family restaurant with delicious food.
en-unannotated-09242	We stopped by for a pint before dinner.
en-unannotated-09243	The quaintness leads to a very intimate dining experience.
en-unannotated-09244	Lots of teams and NOISE.
en-unannotated-09245	OK we've been traveling around Europe for the last few weeks and this place is fantastic.
en-unannotated-09246	The very nice lady at the winery, when asked for a restaurant recommendation with a focus on good cooking, strongly recommended Auberge du Prunelli, and called to secure us a reservation.
en-unannotated-09247	In town for the GnR show.
en-unannotated-09248	My husband and I joined Loly for dinner with Eat With and it was just lovely.
en-unannotated-09249	Before my trip to Milan I booked reservations online a week before.
en-unannotated-09250	Breakfast is amazing........
en-unannotated-09251	We were not disappointed.
en-unannotated-09252	Or just a cup of their mystereous Italian hot chocolate from a beautiful classical...
en-unannotated-09253	Maybe in a middle aged man, who slicks back his hair, wears a three piece suit and dons a bow tie kinda way!
en-unannotated-09254	I'm very glad we found this restaurant at the corner, because it's fairly priced and not that crowded.
en-unannotated-09255	The room was small
en-unannotated-09256	We were all quite full after our meals so didn't opt for dessert.
en-unannotated-09257	The interior of the Bank is beautiful.
en-unannotated-09258	The cafe tables are small, maybe 20 inches diameter and placed three inches apart, and I was eating alone.
en-unannotated-09259	Never the less I was going for lunch not a unknowing "choose your own adventure game" experience.
en-unannotated-09260	We ordered an apple and poppyseed strudel.
en-unannotated-09261	The salmon tartare/avocado was fresh and delicious, and, of course, I had to close with a creme brulee.
en-unannotated-09262	Everything in the minibar is not free so we have to buy bottle water everyday before heading back to the hotel.
en-unannotated-09263	Everything was great!
en-unannotated-09264	Excellent service with great traditional Czech cuisine.
en-unannotated-09265	Very confused by the rating on here for this spot.
en-unannotated-09266	We saved P.Mac's for our last night in Dublin.
en-unannotated-09267	Well I can see why.
en-unannotated-09268	We also ate at Jules Verne and liked this much better.
en-unannotated-09269	They gave us great rooms, the best service.
en-unannotated-09270	Well done guys, keep going.
en-unannotated-09271	And I should not have to upgrade to premium to do this.
en-unannotated-09272	Highly recommend.
en-unannotated-09273	stops halfway and then you have to watch all the ads again?
en-unannotated-09274	and i met the same servant - Thomas as i did two years ago.
en-unannotated-09275	I never choose duck but I'm so glad I did.
en-unannotated-09276	Do something plz or I will delete this game.
en-unannotated-09277	His passion was on full display with the feast, each course was intricately prepared and was specifically designed to engage all of our senses.
en-unannotated-09278	The desserts are also very delicious.
en-unannotated-09279	If you don't have good French speaking skills to call for reservations, like me, come here in person right before 7:30PM to ask for a table for dinner.
en-unannotated-09280	Our room was tastefully decorated, very clean and just renovated with a large modern bathroom.
en-unannotated-09281	The entrance is small and easy to miss.
en-unannotated-09282	Work out facilities were clean and new.

en-unannotated-09286	Pate aux gorgonzola and risotto aux scampi.
en-unannotated-09287	Price: Lunch is very reasonable.
en-unannotated-09288	Take a tray,stand in line, choose meals that are paid for at the cash register.
en-unannotated-09289	We sat out in the back patio (a great venue for beer drinking) and started off with local beer specialties.
en-unannotated-09290	I do not understand the ratings of this restaurant.
en-unannotated-09291	The food is incredible - we had the duck and Belgian meatballs, followed by a delicious...
en-unannotated-09292	Small hole in the wall, but great Pizza and tapas.

en-unannotated-09295	This side of the canal saint martin has long suffered from a lack of great dining options, but I bet that Fraîche is going to change all that and likely open up a wave of new arrivals on this more quite side of the canal.
en-unannotated-09296	much more a 4+ one in my opinion.
en-unannotated-09297	The rooms were clean, the beds were comfortable and the add ons made for a relaxing, worry-free trip.
en-unannotated-09298	same for the other people at our table.
en-unannotated-09299	On the first occasion my seafood shabu-shabu for one blew me out of the water.
en-unannotated-09300	Sorry SoundCloud, but that needs to be fixed.
en-unannotated-09301	This place offers free breakfast and dinner everyday.
en-unannotated-09302	add promotion add on my account.
en-unannotated-09303	It has been here like forever, I remember visiting 12 years ago!
en-unannotated-09304	All of this is set in a beautiful building as well.
en-unannotated-09305	Very fairly priced.
en-unannotated-09306	A very beautiful and posh restaurant in the city of Moscow.
en-unannotated-09307	I was very impressed with the main courses.
en-unannotated-09308	There are also several choices for vegetarians...
en-unannotated-09309	My wife and I travel a lot and love coffee.
en-unannotated-09310	This facility is attached to a mall which makes it very convenient for food, shopping and interaction.
en-unannotated-09311	Way too many adds you can't back out of.
en-unannotated-09312	OK, I'll try and make this somewhat brief.
en-unannotated-09313	Super crowded and certainly hard to find a table for 7, but when do have the opportunity to go to a bar this old.
en-unannotated-09314	1 star only for dev's attention :'(
en-unannotated-09315	The quality of the meat is excellent, as I would expect knowing how popular this place is and that in theory if you're a legit butcher shop you better have good meat.
en-unannotated-09316	The rooms were very spacious, and bathrooms well-appointed.
en-unannotated-09317	Their risottos are delicious but incredibly rich.
en-unannotated-09318	I love it when we order dishes and are unable to completely figure out how the flavors, textures and overall dish was created.
en-unannotated-09319	I use Done deal to sell anything
en-unannotated-09320	He tried his English with us and we tried our italian with him.
en-unannotated-09321	When I got over the sticker shock (€18-25 for basic, pub food mains), I tried to troubleshoot the issue by contemplating a split order between me and the husband.
en-unannotated-09322	Before I had updated this game it was working proparly but now after I updated it there are way too many adds even if we swith off internet so that we can play peacefully those stupid adds show up.
en-unannotated-09323	This outstanding place manages to maintain decent prices for unparalleled quality of service.
en-unannotated-09324	Buttery, herby, woodsy goodness all sopped up in their wonderfully warm basket of bread.
en-unannotated-09325	It's updated with fresh ingredients.
en-unannotated-09326	From the time we arrived to when we bade them farewell, we had the most welcoming dining experience one could hope for.
en-unannotated-09327	Any place that is so small that it thrives on quality (rather than survives on quantity) is worth a visit in my book.
en-unannotated-09328	Coffee machine and microwave (!), two TVs and other standard stuff.
en-unannotated-09329	I can see coming here again and again.
en-unannotated-09330	My husband had the quail with fois gras sauce and it was delightful.
en-unannotated-09331	You have the option to let your calamari have its final swim in a equally delicious homemade 'bravo' sauce.
en-unannotated-09332	Loly is an amazing chef, who raises vegan food to a whole new level.
en-unannotated-09333	At Le Potager de Pere Thierry the food is made for comfort and satisfaction; there are no frills and thrills hidden in your plate, but rather you will be eating something that reminds you of home, even if France isn't your home.
en-unannotated-09334	The cottage pie was fantastic and a huge portion.
en-unannotated-09335	Soup of the day & the salad tasted fresh.
en-unannotated-09336	We told...
en-unannotated-09337	Close to Colosseum , Trevi Fountain , Spainish Steps and more
en-unannotated-09338	Gave us a map and advice on what to see and where to eat.
en-unannotated-09339	I tried goulash a few times while I was in Prague and I preferred it at this place.
en-unannotated-09340	I recommend the vegetarian option with arugula, cheese, creme fraiche, and an egg.
en-unannotated-09341	Drinks in the bar were very expensive but all other aspects were very pleasant.
en-unannotated-09342	The prices were great considering its in a touristy part of town.
en-unannotated-09343	It was a great start to a trying day.
en-unannotated-09344	As a non-coffee drinker, it's really lovely to go somewhere that coffee is not the feature of the restaurant.
en-unannotated-09345	It just very rarely gets you a taxi when you need it.
en-unannotated-09346	Venue: Modern and cool.
en-unannotated-09347	Whenever I've tried something else, it is equally good.
en-unannotated-09348	It was Easter weekend and a small cozy place so I made reservations around two weeks in advance.
en-unannotated-09349	My boyfriend and I went two days in a row so ended up trying most things on the menu, all fab.
en-unannotated-09350	The place is very small and cozy.
en-unannotated-09351	Very well equipped.
en-unannotated-09352	Somewhat restricted menu with fixed prix but typical of Paris restaurants.
en-unannotated-09353	The second trip we got seated at the bar and served by Larry (?). Dude was the MAN.
en-unannotated-09354	This was the first time I visited Mexico city.
en-unannotated-09355	We started off with the trio dip platter.
en-unannotated-09356	Fantastic meal at a very fair price.
en-unannotated-09357	Desert was a hit.
en-unannotated-09358	Menu has several Czech dishes.
en-unannotated-09359	and before finish the time the cue goes to the other hand.
en-unannotated-09360	Thanks for amazing service and talented chef!
en-unannotated-09361	Was in Bogota for a one night work event and this hotel was selected by the company.
en-unannotated-09362	We had the waiter [name].
en-unannotated-09363	An excellent hotel which was super comfortable and with a satisfying breakfast.
en-unannotated-09364	If you want to impress your date, take them here.
en-unannotated-09365	However, I'm glad I knew that there was a large mural of a woman to look out for.
en-unannotated-09366	First I have to highlight the great service and attention of Juan Carlos.
en-unannotated-09367	My spanish was at fault). We had two different variations of Hake.
en-unannotated-09368	However, be careful if you are not an alcohol drinker...
en-unannotated-09369	There is always a queue at the front door in the tiny entry and go there expecting 30 minutes +
en-unannotated-09370	Vegan carrot cupcake tasted like my homemade goods (I'm not a great baker), cheesecake was fine...
en-unannotated-09371	The service was very good, the place was elegant and very decent, and the...
en-unannotated-09372	The sausage was good, and the cheese gnocchi was Excellent (but somewhere between a gnocchi and a spatzel). The beer was decent.
en-unannotated-09373	We had great coffee and toasted ham and cheese croissants....
en-unannotated-09374	I recommend getting the cured meat salad to share (more cured meat than veggies). All the pasta are homemade.
en-unannotated-09375	Very enjoyable!
en-unannotated-09376	But if you're paying for a little luxury then don't expect it.
en-unannotated-09377	I had not stayed at a Red Roof in over 15 years and was surprised at how nice they have transitioned.
en-unannotated-09378	As I write this I am still daydreaming about the buttermilk chicken burger I had here last night (14€) .
en-unannotated-09379	Not luxurious.
en-unannotated-09380	The service at this hotel is really good.
en-unannotated-09381	Excellent!
en-unannotated-09382	The waiter offered to refill my stein of Pilsner Urquell, and there was no sense of urgency or being pushed out to make way for more people which is how I would have felt at Mlejnice Kožná.
en-unannotated-09383	The dumplings were particularly notable with the creative use of a nest of thin noodles as their skin.
en-unannotated-09384	Awesome cuisine served by friendly and attentive staff.
en-unannotated-09385	With that being said, it can be a bit difficult to find.
en-unannotated-09386	Ate at a lot of restaurants and this restaurant was the one of the top four in Milan, Venice, Florence, Tuscany and Rome I've gone to.
en-unannotated-09387	It is expensive so choose wisely, you might be surprised :)
en-unannotated-09388	It was good, but I liked the potatoes they were served with even better.
en-unannotated-09389	What a great restaurant and crew!
en-unannotated-09390	On our 50th anniversary trip, we splurged on the hotel, and it was wonderful.
en-unannotated-09391	Burgers, steak tartare, pastrami.
en-unannotated-09392	We stayed overnight at the beginning of our week in Spain and then for 2 nights at the end of the week.
en-unannotated-09393	When you arrive you'll have to line up to order and immediately receive your food, keep in mind that the line might be long and you might have to...
en-unannotated-09394	The waiter told us that the chef special is a huge portion and should be enough for the three of us.
en-unannotated-09395	I've been to La Provence a few times already.
en-unannotated-09396	Good service, nice vibe, you should definitely check this place out while in Dublin.
en-unannotated-09397	Not great.
en-unannotated-09398	The blood sausage to start was really great - don't be put off by the name!!
en-unannotated-09399	They have a decent craft beer selection and the staff are pretty knowledgeable and friendly.
en-unannotated-09400	It's served in a fresh bread bowl.
en-unannotated-09401	The cakes are a work of art.
en-unannotated-09402	I would definitely stay here again.
en-unannotated-09403	The food at the "Welcome Home Reception" was sparse and unappetizing.
en-unannotated-09404	Staff if excellent.
en-unannotated-09405	Lovely friendly staff, authentic Czech cuisine and to top it all beautiful decor and ambience.
en-unannotated-09406	This includes Goulash served in bread bowls, giant hunks of pork, potatoes baked with cheese and the infamous pork knee.
en-unannotated-09407	The food...
en-unannotated-09408	The veal was thicker than usual but it didn't disappoint, it was super tender and juicy...
en-unannotated-09409	Great tiny cafe with, just as its name says, tapas and wine.
en-unannotated-09410	-TIRAMISU.
en-unannotated-09411	Main bathroom needs a good clean especially around the shower recess.
en-unannotated-09412	Simple and killer.
en-unannotated-09413	We've eaten here a number of times and everything on the menu is excellent.
en-unannotated-09414	We ordered the following:
en-unannotated-09415	First of all, the service was extremely friendly and helpful.
en-unannotated-09416	This place is super popular!
en-unannotated-09417	Thought I would check out a bit of what Brisbane had to offer in regards to more refined dining experiences and saw that Sake was a decent offering if you are in the mood for Japanese.
en-unannotated-09418	3). Great atmosphere.
en-unannotated-09419	There's seating for about 20. There's a $15 minimum for credit card use.
en-unannotated-09420	Enjoy!
en-unannotated-09421	Best tacos we have had in all of Mexico!
en-unannotated-09422	only that "late" check-in (21:00) cost extra 25 Euro, a lot of money
en-unannotated-09423	We came at opening and we're lucky to get seats.
en-unannotated-09424	Beds and pillow were very bad.
en-unannotated-09425	Very friendly and loves all of his customers!
en-unannotated-09426	This place is awesome, we only ordered coffee, but will be back here for food, as we saw the food and ambience, and it looked really good.
en-unannotated-09427	I feel like BREW is a Brisbane right-of-passage.
en-unannotated-09428	Enjoy!!!
en-unannotated-09429	Perfect location, close to navonna, casa di angelo and the vat (walking distance), 2 supermarkets 150 meter.
en-unannotated-09430	A whole monkfish between two, a fab gelatinous cod cheeks...
en-unannotated-09431	The roasted chicken and pork tenderloin were delicious and we definitely recommend!
en-unannotated-09432	Must try: Brochette de Gambas topped with a garlicky sauce.
en-unannotated-09433	Just be aware that the restaurant is a bit off the grid in terms of location.
en-unannotated-09434	Steaming hot.
en-unannotated-09435	Great restaurant for mexican traditional dishes, like cabrito, mole, enchiladas, chile relleno, gorditas.
en-unannotated-09436	Immeditely we were told it was 16 euros per night to park the car, and if we wanted it, 12 euros for a buffet breakfast.
en-unannotated-09437	The staff was amazing!
en-unannotated-09438	Takes ages to load a programme and often presents a "This does not work" message.
en-unannotated-09439	We drank 2 Urquells and I had a double espresso at the end.
en-unannotated-09440	While I actually enjoy these flavours, they were too powerful and detracted from the other flavours.
en-unannotated-09441	- Onion rings breading was gross.
en-unannotated-09442	Flank steak followed.
en-unannotated-09443	We licked the plate clean.
en-unannotated-09444	Dessert was a real treat, condensed milk pannacotta with Vietnamese coffee syrup.
en-unannotated-09445	The owner went by every table/group making sure everything was ok and was very charming.
en-unannotated-09446	Still fairly good none the less.
en-unannotated-09447	Plenty of beer and whiskey options available.
en-unannotated-09448	Big shout out to previous Yelpers for giving this place a well deserved 4+ stars so I could come find it.
en-unannotated-09449	Seafood linguine was great!
en-unannotated-09450	Helpful staff just a little bit on the expensive side for what you get.
en-unannotated-09451	The meal was massive, meat was flying all over the shop, being devoured by my carnivore beauties.
en-unannotated-09452	But they need to improve the service level and security.
en-unannotated-09453	My Favorite spot to eat at in Prague.
en-unannotated-09454	We came for the early bird dinner, which was significantly cheaper and had no wait.
en-unannotated-09455	Definitely recommend.
en-unannotated-09456	we stayed 3 nights at this hotel.
en-unannotated-09457	Although its dark inside, the people who run this place are definitely full of bright ideas because the food being brought out to people looks fantastic.
en-unannotated-09458	SOOOOOO FUN!!
en-unannotated-09459	Highly recommended.
en-unannotated-09460	Best Mexican food in the Zona Rosa
en-unannotated-09461	I love the atmosphere (and the leather menus!), which is laid back and unassuming.
en-unannotated-09462	Amazing meal the bruschetta to start was simple one of the best I've had - no lie!
en-unannotated-09463	John Mills Himself has a hot chocolate menu - with such exotic flavours as lavender hot chocolate.
en-unannotated-09464	For appetizers, I ordered the baked scallop and mozzarella caprese.
en-unannotated-09465	The hotel is right in the heart of the city around 45 minutes from the airport.
en-unannotated-09466	Would advise to make a reservation.
en-unannotated-09467	Simple, affordable and a great taste.
en-unannotated-09468	Excellent hotel hidden away in a back street.
en-unannotated-09469	Wow.
en-unannotated-09470	last order at 12 ...
en-unannotated-09471	Everything was delicious and presented well.
en-unannotated-09472	Nase Maso is not only unique butcher shop, deli, and restaurant but an experience.
en-unannotated-09473	I've turned by nose up at goulash since I was a child and those days are over.
en-unannotated-09474	This is by far the best Pizza I've had in Colombia.
en-unannotated-09475	Brazen Head has a lot going for it; over 800 years of selling alcohol in Dublin, a cool logo, convenient spot, live music some nights, decent food, and well-stocked bars.
en-unannotated-09476	probably came because of the Yelp rating.
en-unannotated-09477	We had the champion pizza that not only looked great but was delicious as well.
en-unannotated-09478	The food was absolutely fresh and delicious.
en-unannotated-09479	Really great lady on reception, she was busy but doing a great job for everyone.
en-unannotated-09480	We had breakfast here twice and it was excellent (and I would have returned we stay longer). You can ask for freshly pressed orange juice and real strong coffee to accompany all the pastries and cakes.
en-unannotated-09481	This time around we ordered their famous meatloaf, sausage trio, and a 12-hour braised beef belly - 5/5. We loved the beef belly.
en-unannotated-09482	Very poor hotel and wouldn't recommend it
en-unannotated-09483	Unforgettable!
en-unannotated-09484	The sides served...
en-unannotated-09485	Risoelatte is coming back to grandma's house!
en-unannotated-09486	It worked a treat.
en-unannotated-09487	Cant recommend this place enough.
en-unannotated-09488	Given the overly generous portion sizes for our starters and mains the four of us opted to share two desserts rather than go solo.
en-unannotated-09489	You can put that in the genius world record book it would be cool to see silver aisle in a book or this game I should say wow this game is made so many improvements like update and controls period period period period period period period anyway I love this game so much that when I delete it death yet but you could collect.
en-unannotated-09490	Thank you :) x
en-unannotated-09491	Pretty much the entire restaurant is essentially inside a 700-year-old cave, which served as a wine cellar.
en-unannotated-09492	Location is great, room spacious modern and clean, staff is kind and helpful.
en-unannotated-09493	They were let down by a bad service unfortunately.
en-unannotated-09494	time has passed we went back to them to get the keys and I was so surprised to walk in a room with a dirty glass from the mini bar a leftover that they forgot to clean maybe?
en-unannotated-09495	The Survey Co, is no questions, one sexy restaurant that is not only aesthetically pleasing, but also delivers big on atmosphere, with it's intimate setting, and of course dishes that are Superb!
en-unannotated-09496	Queue early for check-out
en-unannotated-09497	couldn't have asked for a more central location with some of the best attractions right on our doorstep.
en-unannotated-09498	Proportion of those two are considerable.
en-unannotated-09499	Seasonal menu (lunch) is a great option for not expending that much and having a wonderful experience
en-unannotated-09500	Astonishing and gorgeous plates with an extraordinary service...
en-unannotated-09501	Located close to subway, room for approx 25 guest.
en-unannotated-09502	The food is great compared to the reasonably low price.
en-unannotated-09503	There are a bunch of live concert posters on the wall as you walk into the building as well as funky art sprinkled along the walls.
en-unannotated-09504	One of the best Ossobuco I've ever had.
en-unannotated-09505	We didn't know what to expect when it came to Czech food but we saw a lot of good reviews of this place so we decided to try it out here.
en-unannotated-09506	In mid-May 2017, my wife and I stayed in a "terrace suite" and two friends stayed in a fifth floor room all for five days.
en-unannotated-09507	They server was extremely warm and welcoming as he explained the choices on the two course menu.
en-unannotated-09508	During the winter if you would like to mix up your hot beverage intake they offer an epicurean range of hot chocolates.
en-unannotated-09509	For entree I got the vegetarian chili boxty and WOW it was soooo good!
en-unannotated-09510	The magret de canard with the caramelized bananas was insane, just sweet enough and an unexpected match between the game and the fruit.
en-unannotated-09511	Every time I am there I am always impressed with the service and general attitude of the staff.
en-unannotated-09512	Using back button sends you loop of exit yes/no.
en-unannotated-09513	I wasn't overly hungry and generally don't react well to bread but the truffle mushroom butter sounded too enticing so I gave in and I am so glad I did.
en-unannotated-09514	It was not quite as good as the beef belly, but our second favourite dish - 4/5.
en-unannotated-09515	It was such a fresh and delicious way to start off the day!
en-unannotated-09516	The server Magda was very welcoming and we had nice chats through out the meal.
en-unannotated-09517	I mean really?
en-unannotated-09518	For my partner this was de spareribs (with a potato in foil) and for me duck in blueberry sauce.
en-unannotated-09519	I would definitely stay there again!
en-unannotated-09520	We were somewhat lost and hungry.
en-unannotated-09521	For dessert we had the seasonal pumpkin pie, also fantastic.
en-unannotated-09522	Highly recommended and in a central location close to tube and buses.
en-unannotated-09523	If you're a huge risotto fan like me then you're bound to fall in love with this place.
en-unannotated-09524	The place was not busy and I was able to get a nice table by the window looking out on Mount Street Lower.
en-unannotated-09525	Could tKe or leave the wagyu gyoza though - was just something missing in the flavour that needed some soy sauce and wasabi to
en-unannotated-09526	We tasted classic burger and the gazpacho.
en-unannotated-09527	my dates for a full week of watching and enjoying Memorial Golf Tournament started 5/29 thru 6/5, very friendly front desk staff when checking in...
en-unannotated-09528	However overall it was a pleasant meal spanning the length of four hours shared with an old and new friend.
en-unannotated-09529	Rooms are big and beds are super comfy.
en-unannotated-09530	Nothing.
en-unannotated-09531	The service is a bit slow but at least you're always greeted with a smile.
en-unannotated-09532	I ordered the Veal Milanese and my friend ordered the steak.
en-unannotated-09533	I can't confirm the "authenticity" of the food here, but I can tell you that it is quite nice.
en-unannotated-09534	Wonderful family-owned and run restaurant.
en-unannotated-09535	Food was great and service very good
en-unannotated-09536	Was perfect!!!
en-unannotated-09537	There is not 24 h room service ..
en-unannotated-09538	Chicken satay was very average.
en-unannotated-09539	I cannot recommend this restaurant enough!!
en-unannotated-09540	Or, i'll come back in Bonifacio!
en-unannotated-09541	Hehe maybe that was my fault but....
en-unannotated-09542	And we had the unluck of sitting at a table where we could look straight towards a gigantic...
en-unannotated-09543	Good selection of food and booze.
en-unannotated-09544	Next time I aim to try the food as well as the cocktails.
en-unannotated-09545	Really the best in Barcelona and we tried 4 other famous gelataria there.
en-unannotated-09546	Great date night dinner.
en-unannotated-09547	The service is exceptional and the food is delicious!!!!
en-unannotated-09548	Potentially too hip for me to attend on a regular basis).
en-unannotated-09549	Phenomenal service, all around super friendly staff that truly loves the food they make.
en-unannotated-09550	The hotel really is a home away from home.
en-unannotated-09551	Our other friends who tried other dishes let us try some of their food and it was all terrific as well.
en-unannotated-09552	You might hesitate because of the location, but that is not a problem.
en-unannotated-09553	From this moment on we knew it would get amazing.
en-unannotated-09554	The staff is exceptional and they know their craft.
en-unannotated-09555	my High School Italian teacher is probably gesturing his Italian hands in disgust.
en-unannotated-09556	Had the fried calamari/zucchini as a starter...
en-unannotated-09557	The herb bread was a great start with a generous amount of melted cheese on top.
en-unannotated-09558	Seemed very cheap and stingy to me.
en-unannotated-09559	My usual picks were the Dry aged hamburger (it is served medium rare and practically melts in your mouth) and the steak tartar, which comes with toast and garlic cloves to rub on the toast for more flavor.
en-unannotated-09560	The perfect end to a trip to Paris.
en-unannotated-09561	The room was very clean, with a comfortable bed and lots of pillows.
en-unannotated-09562	Overall, a super memorable experience.
en-unannotated-09563	It was raining that day so it provided some nice cover.
en-unannotated-09564	This is a very nice hotel, room was bright and modern.
en-unannotated-09565	The salad was the perfect compliment to this.
en-unannotated-09566	First of all, the toilet is very small and dirty.
en-unannotated-09567	Tucked away down an alley, it provides a fantastic vibe and a great place to take your colleagues, if you want to impress them.
en-unannotated-09568	Don't even think about it, just come here!
en-unannotated-09569	During our holiday to Barcelona, we had the privalege of having dinner with Nico and Xavie.
en-unannotated-09570	We ordered:
en-unannotated-09571	Great service and friendly staff who speak good English if your Spanish is rusty
en-unannotated-09572	Then came the risotto.
en-unannotated-09573	The cocktails particularly the mojitos and cosmos were so lush....
en-unannotated-09574	Amazing!
en-unannotated-09575	Not the best in the city, but very very far from the worst.
en-unannotated-09576	We ordered off the daily menu.
en-unannotated-09577	It was amazing, I can say this is the best Mexican restaurant I have ever gone to.
en-unannotated-09578	Very.
en-unannotated-09579	Well lit comfortable rooms with all the amenities required for business travel.
en-unannotated-09580	Famed institution in Montmartre district notorious for their gourmet duck dishes.
en-unannotated-09581	Their version is some of the best I've had anywhere.
en-unannotated-09582	I'm already planning my next trip back.
en-unannotated-09583	My husband swears this is the best steak in Paris.
en-unannotated-09584	Down the staircase below the Metro Arts Building is a hidden Brisbane secret, that is apparently not so secret to everyone but me!
en-unannotated-09585	Milanese was good but pork chop was undercooked.
en-unannotated-09586	We stayed at this hotel for two nights.
en-unannotated-09587	The table service was fine, but no better and the slightly cramped interior wasn't desirable but not a huge issue.
en-unannotated-09588	We visited the property in the last week of May and stayed for 4 days as a family of 4.
en-unannotated-09589	Just breathtaking!
en-unannotated-09590	Anything duck related!
en-unannotated-09591	rooms are dated and need more natural light , had trouble opening the door on several occasions
en-unannotated-09592	Only complaint was that the side salad was also covered in the sauce, so maybe next time I'd ask for my salad on a separate plate.
en-unannotated-09593	I confirm that rooms are large and well kept.
en-unannotated-09594	No restaurant wants a quiet night but sorry I do prefer a slightly quiter environment such as the night on Mondays or so
en-unannotated-09595	Wouldn't take payment from my card after too many tries.
en-unannotated-09596	Helpful and inviting.
en-unannotated-09597	Service was actually really great!
en-unannotated-09598	We had beers and raspberry lemonade.
en-unannotated-09599	Our seafood risotto have 1 shrimp in it and that's it.
en-unannotated-09600	3. creme brulee
en-unannotated-09601	Drinks: Fairly standard.
en-unannotated-09602	The beer also worked very well with the steak tartare.
en-unannotated-09603	my unic id is 223-087-248-0. please give my coins back.
en-unannotated-09604	The lobster roll however was wanting - I'm used to NYC style lobster rolls from the village with butter toasted hot dog rolls overspilling with richly seasoned lobster salad.
en-unannotated-09605	There was a line out the door when we arrived, which is always a good sign!
en-unannotated-09606	We only had a main course but a nibbles of a watermelon gazpacho with some devinely paper thin crisp bread began our lunch.
en-unannotated-09607	The meatloaf was good, but again not amazing.
en-unannotated-09608	Reason being that I felt I had a few gripes with it that were particular to me that would persuade me to write a 4 star review when in fact Nase Maso overwhelming deserves 5 stars.
en-unannotated-09609	Went here with my girlfriend for some lunch and a cocktail.
en-unannotated-09610	Dine with families all around and enjoy a taste of excellence.
en-unannotated-09611	It was pretty reasonable for a nice dinner out!
en-unannotated-09612	This was very helpful for coordinating plans with my party when we in different areas around the city.
en-unannotated-09613	For example, one of our party asked if they had any cider.
en-unannotated-09614	It's smooth and delicious!
en-unannotated-09615	Very good seafood, mostly fish and shrimp tacos, you get the taco and the protein and then help yourself to the greens you want.
en-unannotated-09616	There was only one waiter for the entire restaurant, but he did an amazing job.
en-unannotated-09617	Flavor wise, I actually preferred BF's pancakes more.
en-unannotated-09618	The music was pretentious as were the staff.
en-unannotated-09619	This is a relatively new, stylish, modern hotel on the edge of downtown San Sebastian, in a more residential neighborhood.
en-unannotated-09620	Big portions!
en-unannotated-09621	Sadly, the facilities were below expectation, the hotel is pretty old and has not been renovated.
en-unannotated-09622	Highly recommend this restaurant throughout the Czech Republic!
en-unannotated-09623	Third, hate to dull the review with poor service.
en-unannotated-09624	Warm, attentive service, interesting things to look at on the walls, delicious food.
en-unannotated-09625	Check.
en-unannotated-09626	The two outdoor seating areas are perfect for a coffee or a drink.
en-unannotated-09627	Very local place with a full menu, one draft beer, and a decent wine selection.
en-unannotated-09628	Staff excellent.
en-unannotated-09629	Easily done on their website.
en-unannotated-09630	Potatoes w mushroom, leek, bacon, cheese
en-unannotated-09631	very good location....
en-unannotated-09632	The Chef's Starter and the Chef's Steak was to die for.
en-unannotated-09633	each time the service was good and the food was delicious.
en-unannotated-09634	Complimentary house bread (grilled with oil and herbs), Penne arrabiata with the addition of seafood (like spaghetti frutti di mare), water (bottle was cold!
en-unannotated-09635	And that meatloaf-- yummmm.
en-unannotated-09636	everything is affordable and great quality.
en-unannotated-09637	What a find!
en-unannotated-09638	Also we weren't given the room that we reserved for the second time of me visiting .
en-unannotated-09639	I am in dire need of veggies after enjoying stable meat and potato type dishes in Europe.
en-unannotated-09640	...........
en-unannotated-09641	I went downstairs and requested another room.
en-unannotated-09642	Very tasty result and also good Fries served.
en-unannotated-09643	I liked the service, staff were friendly, polite and efficient.
en-unannotated-09644	For such a memorable and delicious meal, I thought the price was quite good.
en-unannotated-09645	Worth checking out.
en-unannotated-09646	On this trip, I discover that the airport shuttles no longer operate, but the taxis are easy to find.
en-unannotated-09647	Had dinner here the their night and wow it was good.
en-unannotated-09648	This was a great place to stay.
en-unannotated-09649	I asked the waiter for his food recommendations and he pointed to the Irish Stew with lamb and the Beef and Guinness Stew.
en-unannotated-09650	This place is definitely popular for locals and almost everyone was having a beer.
en-unannotated-09651	Ubers galore in the area.
en-unannotated-09652	Service is great, location perfect for a stroll after dinner.
en-unannotated-09653	So we were able to walk off our pinchos and wine.
en-unannotated-09654	I had the fish pie, piping hot and full of fresh fish which is a nice change from other places full of mash.
en-unannotated-09655	Amazing location.
en-unannotated-09656	The crab cakes were divine.
en-unannotated-09657	I...
en-unannotated-09658	I personally thought the lamb steak was the best of them all.
en-unannotated-09659	Works some days & not others.
en-unannotated-09660	Welcome by the friendly and cheerful receptionist upon arrival.
en-unannotated-09661	10 mins walk from closest metro stop.
en-unannotated-09662	They didnt reply on mails etc...
en-unannotated-09663	Salmon was very good, perfectly moist and the orzo side with mushroom cream sauce was delicious, more so considering I don't like mushrooms.
en-unannotated-09664	A very good restaurant, surprisingly busy at 2pm with many locals.
en-unannotated-09665	Intimate.
en-unannotated-09666	We found a restaurant by trip advisor and we were surprised.
en-unannotated-09667	There are lots of ads but it is definitely worth it.
en-unannotated-09668	The pork skin is really hard to cut and to chew though.
en-unannotated-09669	but here you get a real one: with potatoes, pancetta and onions.
en-unannotated-09670	Having walked for 11 hours thru the Milan World EXPO we had definitely worked up an appitite and this place did not let us down.
en-unannotated-09671	Not including the tip we left.
en-unannotated-09672	The front desk clerk, [name] was darling and very helpful!!
en-unannotated-09673	Every time I go to Moscow, I go to eat at Stolovaya 57, in GUM.
en-unannotated-09674	I was a bit doupting when I heard that I would stay in a two star hotel during my business trip to San Sebastian.
en-unannotated-09675	Spam
en-unannotated-09676	It's a small restaurant so you will most likely be seated with or near someone you don't know but that's most places in Paris.
en-unannotated-09677	I must say that the attention shown in the weeks leading up to my visit did intrigue to my visit.
en-unannotated-09678	It was not easy to figure out where the plates were .
en-unannotated-09679	The fish tacos were excellent.
en-unannotated-09680	I recommend PMacs to my work colleagues so we stopped for a few drinks and dinner.
en-unannotated-09681	Staff are awesome too.
en-unannotated-09682	Highly recommended to go for a full lunch menu.
en-unannotated-09683	The staff was very helpful.
en-unannotated-09684	Spam, should delete it
en-unannotated-09685	The staff is very friendly,...
en-unannotated-09686	Soooooo delicious.
en-unannotated-09687	This hotel is kinda old and they don't even have a water boiler in the room.
en-unannotated-09688	I ate couple of dishes that were best I have ever had.
en-unannotated-09689	Will be back if I'm ever in Milano again!
en-unannotated-09690	I thought they had more flavor.
en-unannotated-09691	Good service good Guinness beer and not very taxing on the billfold so all in all it was a great place for lunch.
en-unannotated-09692	Basic mini bar.
en-unannotated-09693	Presentation might not be very visually appealing but trust me it tasted great.
en-unannotated-09694	, it was like watching a really fine tuned orchesta amazing.....
en-unannotated-09695	I could have easily made it my appetizer, main, and dessert - it's a MUST.
en-unannotated-09696	We ordered it twice.
en-unannotated-09697	Definitely worth a visit in Paris for a very charming and Parisien experience.
en-unannotated-09698	You can thank me later.
en-unannotated-09699	however this could be understandable due to rooms availablity etc ..
en-unannotated-09700	The octopus was delightful.
en-unannotated-09701	The only reason we didn't give 5 rating is the Antiquated TV system and the AC was very difficult to regulate.
en-unannotated-09702	So later, after a show nearby, we decided to pop back in and try the actual food.
en-unannotated-09703	And beer!
en-unannotated-09704	This is a good thing.
en-unannotated-09705	For appetizers, I ordered escargots and French onion soup.
en-unannotated-09706	Our Airbnb host found out our visit was for my mother's 75th birthday and booked us a dinner at this special restaurant.
en-unannotated-09707	Spettacolare!
en-unannotated-09708	However, scrumptious mushrooms and goat cheese pancake as well as classic cinnamon pancakes.
en-unannotated-09709	The food was very good and service even better.
en-unannotated-09710	We were greeted with sangria and olives.
en-unannotated-09711	I enjoyed the hotel back view, because of the quietness.
en-unannotated-09712	We will make this...
en-unannotated-09713	Friendly service!
en-unannotated-09714	Excellent wifi.
en-unannotated-09715	We asked for a fix 3 times and the technician said that he can only restart the router.
en-unannotated-09716	Think juicy sun-dried tomatoes, parmesan cheese, fresh rocket and baby spinach, with a lovely aioli dressing.
en-unannotated-09717	Drinks: Had a great New Zealand Sav.
en-unannotated-09718	I only get the pozole.
en-unannotated-09719	The people are friendly but beware they will try to over charge you in the taxis and on the tours
en-unannotated-09720	and helpful .
en-unannotated-09721	Simple pleasure to round up a rather perfect evening.
en-unannotated-09722	They do not hover and do not ask you when you are ready for a check.
en-unannotated-09723	Keep in mind some sides aren't available with certain dishes.
en-unannotated-09724	Great illustration of top fine dining French couisine The service very professional and personal.
en-unannotated-09725	Opened door as we were coming up the stairs, greetings from all staff as we walked by...
en-unannotated-09726	Perfect
en-unannotated-09727	So delicious!
en-unannotated-09728	Would definitely book again.
en-unannotated-09729	I would say the service is slow.
en-unannotated-09730	Our party of seven had a lovely evening with [name] and [name], who were kind enough to accept our booking at short notice.
en-unannotated-09731	Hence me writing these review.
en-unannotated-09732	Portions were quite large.
en-unannotated-09733	There are 7 tables around us and nobody has food.
en-unannotated-09734	This hotel is the perfect combination of service, value, quality and space.
en-unannotated-09735	We booked a dinner thro Eat With, as a new experience.
en-unannotated-09736	We liked the atmosphere; it was friendly, albeit, very crowded.
en-unannotated-09737	Each dish was incredible.
en-unannotated-09738	Authentic Italian restaurant located in a mixed cultural neighborhood off of the beaten path.
en-unannotated-09739	My boyfriend and I had a wonderful meal our first night for a very reasonable price.
en-unannotated-09740	- Fish and chips - this was literally my husband's 7th order of fish and chips in the previous 10 days and he said it ranked in the bottom 2. The breading wasn't that great, but the chips tasted fine.
en-unannotated-09741	The atmosphere that [NAME] and [NAME] have created in JMH is truly great and it's my kind of bar.
en-unannotated-09742	The details of the different dishes we liked a lot.
en-unannotated-09743	Location, grandeur, extremely professional staff, cleanliness, would do anything for you.
en-unannotated-09744	My first time to stay in Madrid so I wasn't quite familiar with the level of quality in hostel like establishment.
en-unannotated-09745	My husband had the pork skewers.
en-unannotated-09746	Thanks to the Trip Advisor family, we found this gem and it fit our criteria for great gelato.
en-unannotated-09747	A glorious dilapidated hotel,  full of old charm and magnificence but also so new damp and peeling walls.
en-unannotated-09748	We had 2 salty that was just great, AND a sweet crepe desert, a nutella one, sounds generic but it was so good!
en-unannotated-09749	For myself I ordered the Kingfish - somewhat tasty!
en-unannotated-09750	You will not be disappointed here.
en-unannotated-09751	Food was ok but nothing special, staff & surroundings were uninspiring.
en-unannotated-09752	I asked if they had cups of ice and the cashier didn't understand what I was asking for.
en-unannotated-09753	Fresh !
en-unannotated-09754	It wasn't too big of a deal since I could open a window and let the cool air in at night.
en-unannotated-09755	Miel was the first meal we had upon landing in Brisbane and it set the bar very high for the food for the rest of the trip.
en-unannotated-09756	The appetizers were better - particularly the goose pate, which was served with sweet marinated onions and raisins.
en-unannotated-09757	The best way to eat here (in my opinion) is to come with at least one other person, order a big meat dish to split, and order cheap side dishes and eat family style!
en-unannotated-09758	The place was located near the main church of San Sebastian in the old town.
en-unannotated-09759	Small rooms
en-unannotated-09760	Its breakfast is excellent breakfast and its juice bar is outstanding.
en-unannotated-09761	It was very rich, but also delicious.
en-unannotated-09762	I think I was the only tourist there on a Saturday afternoon.
en-unannotated-09763	A nice little oasis from the noise and heat.
en-unannotated-09764	We ended up waiting a little bit for our table, but were seated after about 10 minutes as they cleared one the tables.
en-unannotated-09765	Lots of nice amenities, including breakfast in the top floor roof-top restaurant.
en-unannotated-09766	Easily go here again for a special occasion.
en-unannotated-09767	The Hotel de Londres y Inglaterra in San Sebastian has excellent reviews on the major travel sites and for good reason – the location is superb and the rooms and common areas are first class.
en-unannotated-09768	I know wifey was too..
en-unannotated-09769	Since we started the meal with champagne, we typically would only want one large glass of wine (6.5oz pour) each with dinner, and these half bottle selections were high-end but affordable since they were half the price of a full bottle.
en-unannotated-09770	Good idea to prepay the breakfast.
en-unannotated-09771	It does not exist at this hotel.
en-unannotated-09772	Super interesting take on Irish food!
en-unannotated-09773	Be prepared for a messy meal and a burger that won't fit in your mouth.
en-unannotated-09774	Excellent savory pancakes!
en-unannotated-09775	Don't fix it soon and I'm going to uninstall it and remove it from my games list.
en-unannotated-09776	But price need to check very well again
en-unannotated-09777	My risotto was also phenomenal, though I can't say I expected anything less than that.
en-unannotated-09778	They walked us through the menu and we shared a few fun stories regarding our unique cultures.
en-unannotated-09779	I would recommend it to anyone looking for something a little different.
en-unannotated-09780	Great price.
en-unannotated-09781	It's near the Pantheon and Notre Dame.
en-unannotated-09782	The chef graciously showed us what he had prepared specially that day.
en-unannotated-09783	San Sebastian is full of hotels and we were lucky to choose one that is in the nice neighborhood, with helpful staff and spacious rooms.
en-unannotated-09784	However the stay was very enjoyable, rooms were nice, very comfortable bed, lots of pillows always a plus
en-unannotated-09785	We ordered the onion rings, Beer goulash in bread bowl and salad with the same name as the 'raunt.
en-unannotated-09786	Unlike many, many other places which only accept cash, this restaurant did accept credit cards and when I said I would pay with a credit card, he was happy to oblige.
en-unannotated-09787	Menu is not big, but...
en-unannotated-09788	The rooms, the service is truly excellent.
en-unannotated-09789	Best goulash in Prague!
en-unannotated-09790	The staff from front door porter to check in staff were courteous and so helpful.
en-unannotated-09791	I also ordered the french onion soup for 9 euros.
en-unannotated-09792	At over €600 per night it's a very expensive stay for the condition of the hotel.
en-unannotated-09793	I felt compelled to tip him afterwards, what a pleasant experience.
en-unannotated-09794	I found this place thanks to my friend's recommendation.
en-unannotated-09795	You can do a whole lot better for the same price in this town, give it a miss.
en-unannotated-09796	i have 3 legendary cue.
en-unannotated-09797	It is well worth the walk over from where we were.
en-unannotated-09798	They get three loves because of the 1. Tasty food 2. Great beers and 3. Inviting atmosphere
en-unannotated-09799	This completely changed my view of French food which is never my choice of cuisine when eating out.
en-unannotated-09800	Great place and great atmosphere.
en-unannotated-09801	Dont change your mind when you see huge crowd outside, wait for that magic.
en-unannotated-09802	Beautiful service!
en-unannotated-09803	Housed in a cute red container located on a side street in downtown Brisbane!
en-unannotated-09804	We ended up with the pork tenderloin in a red currant sauce (mashed potatoes and salad on the side) and duck in a raspberry sauce (fried potatoe slides, green beans and salad on the side), both were sooo good, we ate the whole plate without leaving a single piece of food on there.
en-unannotated-09805	if i come back to bastia, i'll come back to le petit zinc.
en-unannotated-09806	But I won't.
en-unannotated-09807	If you have to wait, don't be discouraged; you can wait outside of the restaurant (there's no room to wait inside) or you can wander around the immediate area for a little while.
en-unannotated-09808	The bed AND pillows were among the worst I've ever experienced (bed was hard and pillows were no support - I did not sleep well and woke up with neck and shoulder pains). Waited 20 minutes for a table at breakfast; when we were seated, they stopped serving/replenishing and actually started packing up the buffet.
en-unannotated-09809	#1 in CDMX in may2017.
en-unannotated-09810	The first course I chose was this hake dish marinated in vinegar with carrots and onions.
en-unannotated-09811	The highlight for me were the potato dumplings that were every bit as good as most gnocchi that I have had in my life from even the classiest Italian restaurant.
en-unannotated-09812	If you need recommendations ask Ramoni
en-unannotated-09813	This place is a high recommend.
en-unannotated-09814	A must !
en-unannotated-09815	He then offered us a glass of his wine.
en-unannotated-09816	The only downside was the noise level.
en-unannotated-09817	And worth it.
en-unannotated-09818	If you are not capable of doing either of those two things, then I am dearly sorry for you!
en-unannotated-09819	If you are looking for the best pancakes in Prague, go to Den Noc!
en-unannotated-09820	Always a warm and hearty welcome.
en-unannotated-09821	We enjoy friendliness when eating out.
en-unannotated-09822	And at least one of the bartenders was helpful and polite.
en-unannotated-09823	Free wife also helps
en-unannotated-09824	€10 for pizza in such a wonderful place...
en-unannotated-09825	Worth every penny!
en-unannotated-09826	Good in taste while being not expensive at all.
en-unannotated-09827	No too comfortable.
en-unannotated-09828	The service is prompt, helpful and...
en-unannotated-09829	Nevertheless, they were happy for our patronage and helped us through the dining etiquette that I had never had the pleasure of learning before.
en-unannotated-09830	With a minimalist, yet modern interior (and most importantly, air conditioning) we were seated and ready for a refuel.
en-unannotated-09831	I stayed in room 7, it has a sunny balcony overlooking a courtyard with beautiful tree's.
en-unannotated-09832	I've had plenty of Japanese food/sushi but the quality of both dishes was spectacular.
en-unannotated-09833	I hate beer and I liked the taste of this one!
en-unannotated-09834	We started with the bread and it was meh..
en-unannotated-09835	The only reason why I didnt rate it 5 stars is because I wish they would filter some results and come up with cars that would suit you as you search more on this app.
en-unannotated-09836	Rude.
en-unannotated-09837	I had this hamburger helper idea in my head and this goulash knocked my socks off.
en-unannotated-09838	This was the highlight of the meal!!!
en-unannotated-09839	How do I know the waiters are pressured to turn tables?
en-unannotated-09840	We went here everyday during our 5 day stay and we were crazy over it.
en-unannotated-09841	It was such a treat to watch the chef prepare our amazing meal.
en-unannotated-09842	I was able to check in early because my room was ready early.
en-unannotated-09843	I've never seen a place with such an extensive pancake menu.
en-unannotated-09844	This is a solid 4.5 star restaurant.
en-unannotated-09845	My favourite is the "Luna(hope I spell right, anyway the second one on menu). Fresh and creamy.
en-unannotated-09846	Weren't expecting that one, were you?
en-unannotated-09847	Staying at the Skylon Hotel we found this gem across the road.
en-unannotated-09848	Very small windows and tiny beds.
en-unannotated-09849	Everything is excellent, location, front desk, service, attention, friendliness, you name it, they provide it.
en-unannotated-09850	Location is incredible, so close to all the sights!
en-unannotated-09851	Good quality wagyu is usually recommended to be cooked to at least medium due to the marbling, however I typically like to order steaks rare.
en-unannotated-09852	I've also included a photo too.
en-unannotated-09853	Despite the large number of eateries around the Riverside/Eagle St/Southbank areas, there aren't a lot that match all those criteria but Black Bird seemed to tick all the boxes so I made a reservation.
en-unannotated-09854	The rooms in the new tower are huge.
en-unannotated-09855	Constantly crashes.
en-unannotated-09856	Ate here 2 days in a row on our trip to Prague.
en-unannotated-09857	The breakfast is good.
en-unannotated-09858	The hotel does have parking, but it is not user friendly.
en-unannotated-09859	Bed was very comfortable if you like hard beds.
en-unannotated-09860	Location , hotel period decor
en-unannotated-09861	Dip onion rings in it?
en-unannotated-09862	4. Beef with creamed corn, carrots, mushrooms.
en-unannotated-09863	The staff were lovely and friendly.
en-unannotated-09864	Bus stop right in front of the hotel which makes it accessible to the city where there is limited parking space.
en-unannotated-09865	The veal was so tender, the sauce so tasty, went perfectly with the fries.
en-unannotated-09866	Perfectly located in the city.
en-unannotated-09867	This little gem was close to our AirBnB.
en-unannotated-09868	I was expecting a high quality brunch.
en-unannotated-09869	My wife had researched this restaurant for our 40th wedding anniversary and it did not fail...!!!
en-unannotated-09870	It wasn't warm enough.
en-unannotated-09871	On a business visit to San Sebastian, one night stay and I would stay here again.
en-unannotated-09872	To start I had the prawn chilli risotto which was a very generous portion and stuffed with prawns.
en-unannotated-09873	Very close to campo de fiori where there is a great market and a great atmosphere.
en-unannotated-09874	No one offered coffee, after my question on fried egg the waiter sent me 'to take menu from the other table'.
en-unannotated-09875	Where to start?!
en-unannotated-09876	The atmosphere inside is well done with an medieval deco.
en-unannotated-09877	The decor and lighting gives the restaurant an excellent romantic feel and the open kitchen really allows you to watch the staff work their magic.
en-unannotated-09878	Definitely recommend Krystal Grand Reforma Uno Hotel is a great location.
en-unannotated-09879	I'd like to see the movement in the multiplayer mode get smoother, and I think it would be fun if there's a "last man standing" option.
en-unannotated-09880	Tucked away in the corner of the market, we visited here as TripAdvisor ratings were high and were not disappointed.
en-unannotated-09881	This is a great hotel with beautiful and clean rooms and friendly staff.
en-unannotated-09882	I liked the potato dumplings better, but I was honestly not a huge fan of either because it was so heavy and I would definitely not eat them on its own.
en-unannotated-09883	I will never stay in this worsest hotel.
en-unannotated-09884	Did not have to take buses or taxis
en-unannotated-09885	It would have been great, but the poppy seeds were rancid.
en-unannotated-09886	It was a quiet night but we liked the place itself.
en-unannotated-09887	The dressing on the salad was phenomenal but the goat cheese was just average.
en-unannotated-09888	Terrace was closed to even look at.
en-unannotated-09889	However, the hotel restaurant is disorganized, takes a long time to serve food, food is warm to cold when served.
en-unannotated-09890	Service was excellent.
en-unannotated-09891	oh and did I mention the food was great.
en-unannotated-09892	And I can't remember the name of the other dish.
en-unannotated-09893	Came twice in my week in Prague and would come again once I return to town.
en-unannotated-09894	Very popular place, so you'll have to make a reservation online.
en-unannotated-09895	Anyway, I would definitely come back here (hopefully for a start-to-finish 5 star lunch!)
en-unannotated-09896	Service for drinks in the garden upon arrival was slow and brusque.
en-unannotated-09897	What I love about this place in particular is the staff.
en-unannotated-09898	Really not worth the money
en-unannotated-09899	Yuck.
en-unannotated-09900	Local crowd, which is always a good sign, and in such a great area.
en-unannotated-09901	Yes this wasn't a fancy place, but I gave it 5 stars because it not only met my expectations of a casual pancake cafe but exceeded them due to the wonderful service simple yet extremely tasty food.
en-unannotated-09902	We had an early departure before sunrise, they even prepared breakfast for us to take away.
en-unannotated-09903	I made a reservation for lunch about a week in advance.
en-unannotated-09904	Plus, spotify is a lot more personalized, with a lot of cool little features.
en-unannotated-09905	We were wandering about on foot looking for an evening meal after a long day and stumbled onto this place.
en-unannotated-09906	Whenever I have to wait until a certain time for something I play this game.
en-unannotated-09907	Salt was in moderation unlike so many other Czech restaurants.
en-unannotated-09908	Will definitely come back.
en-unannotated-09909	They also sell foie gras packed in a mason jar to go or in a can.
en-unannotated-09910	This restaurant is a must mainly if you are in the Red Square.
en-unannotated-09911	The next day we were moved to our room.
en-unannotated-09912	The location is excellent and the appartment is well sized and well equipped for 4 adults
en-unannotated-09913	Place was busy so I'd advise booking, and service was attentive.
en-unannotated-09914	Stayed here for three nights.
en-unannotated-09915	Great Hotel and location.
en-unannotated-09916	rooms and beds cozy and wonderful to be in.
en-unannotated-09917	My daughter and I stayed at this hotel this past weekend and had a great experience!
en-unannotated-09918	The restaurant is super cute, not in an area full of activity but some of the best italian food I've had.
en-unannotated-09919	Would highly recommend.
en-unannotated-09920	lots of nice restaurants around.
en-unannotated-09921	Gina Rinehart lemon curd cocktail.
en-unannotated-09922	I came all the way from Missouri in the USA to see the amazing sights of Paris, France.
en-unannotated-09923	Service excellent and spoke English.
en-unannotated-09924	Coffee very good
en-unannotated-09925	They promised a European dining experience and that's what I got.
en-unannotated-09926	I was so happy to find this little gem!
en-unannotated-09927	A great place for some breakfast food, and the cozy ambiance makes it a very comfortable spot to relax any day of the week.
en-unannotated-09928	They will always be there when I want them.
en-unannotated-09929	During our stay we visited five best rated restaurants in Paris and as Tripadvisor says this is one of the very bests.
en-unannotated-09930	The staff spoke English and were happy to impart information about the area.
en-unannotated-09931	If i ever go back to Milan, I'll definitely come back to this place!
en-unannotated-09932	The lamb stew and soda bread was delicious, and their in house beers were amazing!
en-unannotated-09933	Great value, would stay there again.
en-unannotated-09934	The best chocolate drink!
en-unannotated-09935	You can really chill down here listening to the Doors, CCT , Steely Dan, beers on tap .
en-unannotated-09936	We spent the day walking the city and were famished.
en-unannotated-09937	It was super crowded inside so we ended up just going outside and eating them in the alley while waiting for our cheeseburgers to be done.
en-unannotated-09938	We eat escargot occasionally at our favorite Belgian and French places locally, and this outshone it massively.
en-unannotated-09939	My final assessment was that I could make some of...
en-unannotated-09940	The staff here is the best.
en-unannotated-09941	The room was spacious and very comfortable.
en-unannotated-09942	The best thing is, you can ask for half portions and that way try MORE types of pancakes.
en-unannotated-09943	Un buen lugar para disfrutar un buen trago en compañía de familia, amigos o incluso en un plan mas formal.
en-unannotated-09944	2. connard with sauce du jour (duck filet with sauce of the day - so juicy and tender)
en-unannotated-09945	Incredible.
en-unannotated-09946	Very bad room(superior room was booked).
en-unannotated-09947	Very good value for money, nice comfortable room, bathroom ok, bathroom amenities are basic...
en-unannotated-09948	I have dined here about three times now, first time I was given rockstar treatment with the best seat in the house with views of the Brisbane River and Story Bridge it couldn't get any better than this.
en-unannotated-09949	The size of the towels were tiny, and having requested more these took nearly 2 hours to arrive after chasing the reception.
en-unannotated-09950	These days with unstable rouble a lot of former steak stars like Goodman or Torro in Moscow started to downsize portions, save on service and ingredients to keep price from changing or make it lower.
en-unannotated-09951	We have been to this nice place.
en-unannotated-09952	Next up, the fillet of Irish beef.
en-unannotated-09953	Samsung Smartphone for Internet Hotspot in Rome and Suggestion for Dining and Sightseeing Points, Maps...
en-unannotated-09954	This is a hotel that time forgot.
en-unannotated-09955	Room is small but to be expected in a place like Rome.
en-unannotated-09956	Very nice feature.
en-unannotated-09957	Equivalent of 10usa.
en-unannotated-09958	They have an English menu available but it was outside so I had to take a picture of it before going inside.
en-unannotated-09959	I think I saved the dishwasher a few minutes, because any trace of the above was devoured!
en-unannotated-09960	Excellent and fresh.
en-unannotated-09961	Had an open face...
en-unannotated-09962	The self-served beer is a nice touch too.
en-unannotated-09963	Sorry but this bouncer acted in a unprofessional and naive way with me, misjudging me "what ever he had" in his naive mind!
en-unannotated-09964	I ordered the €25 beef filet with eggplant-- but before I get to that, the restaurant surprised my table with complementary fresh bread (the really delicious thin one resembling pita bread and homemade sun-dried tomato bread were my 2 favorites!
en-unannotated-09965	This is a large hotel.
en-unannotated-09966	Hmmmm; perhaps just for drinks and a snack.
en-unannotated-09967	Our server was attentive and very professional and Covadonga, the chef explained...
en-unannotated-09968	It turns out the servers are very good at remembering whose turn it is to sit down.
en-unannotated-09969	We both ordered the degustation and were very happy with the overall experience.
en-unannotated-09970	Cappuccino was 6.5 EUR.
en-unannotated-09971	I had the shepherds pie.
en-unannotated-09972	Will definitely be back!
en-unannotated-09973	I'm glad I walked all the way home that night.
en-unannotated-09974	Service was friendly and up to standards.
en-unannotated-09975	To me, it would seem odd that it would be served as a main dish, so personally I'd say get it to share kind of like an appetizer.
en-unannotated-09976	not great). We were surprised that...
en-unannotated-09977	Schnitzel was OK, a little salty for me and the potato dumplings were OK.
en-unannotated-09978	But nice storage syncing, always smooth.
en-unannotated-09979	Excellent service and food without all the hazel and trouble of other places.
en-unannotated-09980	I couldn't get the air conditioning to work properly, but it did work.
en-unannotated-09981	It is a tad heavy though so make sure you clear your afternoon schedule and give yourself time to digest.
en-unannotated-09982	A menu printed like it's written by hand explains the Risoelatte philosophy and presents all the dishes they have as well as a separated special of the day menu.
en-unannotated-09983	Our hosts- chefs made this family-friend reunion an unforgettable experience.
en-unannotated-09984	We followed his lead.
en-unannotated-09985	Had issues before with the app saying that the driver was coming even though the driver had never accepted my call.
en-unannotated-09986	Recommended by our Spanish friends and didn't disappoint at all!
en-unannotated-09987	I have had it before on my tablet, it was a great game but now while I am playing it will play ad's in the middle of my game and it was not happening on any of my other apps.
en-unannotated-09988	Definitely no better way to spend a night out in this area!
en-unannotated-09989	My sister and I are both gluten and dairy-free, and this place offers multiple options for any type of diet (gluten/dairy/sugar-free and vegans!).
en-unannotated-09990	This place had wonderful food, fresh and flavorful.
en-unannotated-09991	You know you're at a nice place when you pay a lot of money for a small portion.
en-unannotated-09992	Proof is in one of the wine rooms whose upside down bathtub, with vintage decanter feature lights are said to be from the set of The Great Gatsby movie.
en-unannotated-09993	Music is good!
en-unannotated-09994	I will definitely be back again.
en-unannotated-09995	Had the spaghettini!
en-unannotated-09996	Arriving after 7PM on a cold evening, it was great to be seated at the sushi bar and be welcomed by the staff in such an enthusiastic manner.
en-unannotated-09997	I wouldn't order it again.
en-unannotated-09998	We both ordered a chicken burger with fries....
en-unannotated-09999	Can't beat the location!!!!
en-unannotated-10000	Juicy meat and delicious sauce.
en-unannotated-10001	I was actually super impressed with her speed and efficiency.
en-unannotated-10002	I love having these guys so close to work.
en-unannotated-10003	Please do check these rubbish stuffs...
en-unannotated-10004	The bread was hard and cold.
en-unannotated-10005	that simple.
en-unannotated-10006	Food was excellent and service is efficient and discrete.
en-unannotated-10007	I only stopped in the bakery and did not sit down for more food, but the pastries were great.
en-unannotated-10008	Hotel was recently remodeled.
en-unannotated-10009	The rooms were VERY big!
en-unannotated-10010	We took salads and they were really good.
en-unannotated-10011	Diana and Andrea managed to recreate in central Moscow the atmosphere of an Italian coffee bar.
en-unannotated-10012	I followed that with the lamb shank which fell off the bone and was truly delicious.
en-unannotated-10013	The servers ,were so delightful .
en-unannotated-10014	Ummm how about because this restaurant is some sick homage to Il Duce and fascism????
en-unannotated-10015	The apartment fit the description perfectly.
en-unannotated-10016	The first, dinner with colleagues, which I had to unfortunately excuse myself from just before the mains arrived due to an overwhelming migraine.
en-unannotated-10017	I didn't understand how she was going to keep track of who came in first and whose turn it was to be seated.
en-unannotated-10018	Get your classy-posh self out for a night.
en-unannotated-10019	This used to load new messages by itself.
en-unannotated-10020	Room was somewhat underwhelming as bed was uncomfortable and we kept rolling to center dip.
en-unannotated-10021	We visited JG with friends and it took us over forty minutes to get a table.
en-unannotated-10022	very delicious.
en-unannotated-10023	We had limited options to choose from the menu because most of the dishes take a while to prepare and cook.
en-unannotated-10024	We have been here for a cup of coffee and small sweeties.
en-unannotated-10025	So I end up connected on Trip...
en-unannotated-10026	The gorgeous pictures they have uploaded do not represent the real appearance of the hotel.
en-unannotated-10027	well...
en-unannotated-10028	just a great way to wrap it all up!
en-unannotated-10029	The one in Chia is still amazing, but having the option in Bogotá is great!
en-unannotated-10030	Speaking some French certainly helps (we found this a problem...
en-unannotated-10031	This little place is amazing.
en-unannotated-10032	The food is good, but is uneven.
en-unannotated-10033	One thing I will note is that the food does take a small amount of time to reach your table as everything is made to order and is fresh.
en-unannotated-10034	The bottom line is: Bizon is a place get good stake.
en-unannotated-10035	I was traveling alone and had a very nice meal at the bar here on Valentine's Day.
en-unannotated-10036	Or the replay feature could help sort the issue out.
en-unannotated-10037	Lot's of places to eat in Paris, but I've made it back here 3 times.
en-unannotated-10038	After the moth in the soup, you think the service would be nicer to compensate.
en-unannotated-10039	Overall a good value.
en-unannotated-10040	Thank you, [NAME], for running the table start to finish.
en-unannotated-10041	It has a very tender beef and mushrooms in a creamy sauce wrapped by a potato pancake.
en-unannotated-10042	On the grand Gran Via, in the middle of Madrid, stands a wonderful hotel that has welcomed me for years.
en-unannotated-10043	I would suggest to make a reservation !
en-unannotated-10044	Resonable prices!
en-unannotated-10045	They questioned her on it too!
en-unannotated-10046	We are very disappointed here.
en-unannotated-10047	..
en-unannotated-10048	The decor is imaginative and original, the artwork in the rooms is whimsical, and everything looks new, colorful and well-conceived.
en-unannotated-10049	The use of "had we been sensible" implies that we ended up having 1.5 desserts each because we both ordered the cannoli and then decided to share a dark chocolate tart, too.
en-unannotated-10050	Old tv inside and weak WiFi.
en-unannotated-10051	The bed and pillows were comfortable.
en-unannotated-10052	Three stars for the coffee and the atmosphere.
en-unannotated-10053	If you are planning to have dinner in Churchill´s make sure to make your reservation ahead of time as they have strong demand.
en-unannotated-10054	It's best if you keep the 2 upgrades at the same level.
en-unannotated-10055	We had a great group of nine comprising 4 groupings of people who did not know each other before the evening.
en-unannotated-10056	i also not getting any promotional add for any que purchase, coin purchase...
en-unannotated-10057	I thought the sausages were nothing special, they were good but wasn't bursting with flavor like I thought they would be.
en-unannotated-10058	This is the perfect example of why I believe any establishment with a 4.5 or higher rating.
en-unannotated-10059	The bar serves proper Old Fashioneds and other mixed drinks like whiskey sours and manhattans.
en-unannotated-10060	The steak was stunning.
en-unannotated-10061	Best online pool game...
en-unannotated-10062	Somewhat hidden down in the basement of the Metro Arts building this place has that darkened "underground" almost Berlin-esque (it's probably the red walls) feel to it that once you enter makes you kind of forget that you're in the middle of the CBD.
en-unannotated-10063	Breakfast was included, and looked great.
en-unannotated-10064	Came for convention at IFEMA.
en-unannotated-10065	Russian fast food.
en-unannotated-10066	New hotel, recently renovated in charming building, with a modern and functional taste.
en-unannotated-10067	A bit out of town from San Sebastian and not easy to find but plenty of free parking.
en-unannotated-10068	Their apartment was easy to find, comfortable to be in and immaculately kept.
en-unannotated-10069	It's imported from Herefordshire in England and is an apple cider that is crisp and perfect for this hot Brisbane summer.
en-unannotated-10070	If you order oysters ($35) you get 8 which is not enough to share and pushes you to order two serves.
en-unannotated-10071	We both had the Classic sandwich (9€) and a single order of fries to share.
en-unannotated-10072	We live about 2 hours away and make a Zoo trip yearly.
en-unannotated-10073	Friendly, but professional staff.
en-unannotated-10074	The crepes were delicious, the service was lovely, and the prices were reasonable.
en-unannotated-10075	How rude!
en-unannotated-10076	We ordered:
en-unannotated-10077	There are no transfer from the airport on request, no any email, Booking.
en-unannotated-10078	Play with friends, and followers to show them how much u appreciate them!
en-unannotated-10079	Basically, Olive Garden has better Italian food.
en-unannotated-10080	Fries were also cooked to perfection, crispy and thick!
en-unannotated-10081	A/C worked fine.
en-unannotated-10082	I really do love soundcloud.
en-unannotated-10083	The slice was really big and the pizza good in taste.
en-unannotated-10084	Limited menu of 8 items and great tamales.
en-unannotated-10085	Thats the kind of cool that this place oozes...
en-unannotated-10086	The risotto portions were very generous.
en-unannotated-10087	We are visiting Barcelona for the first time.
en-unannotated-10088	Don't bother with getting appetizers, because it's a huge amount of food, and I almost can't imagine choosing anything else (though I am certain that the rest of the menu is just as delicious).
en-unannotated-10089	Easy and clear interface - no problem with the geo location (unlike uber)
en-unannotated-10090	It has always been a place you want to return if your comin back to the area.
en-unannotated-10091	Some of the key takeaways for the Prague restaurant:
en-unannotated-10092	We ordered a range of starters and mains and everything was just fine but we skipped dessert because we felt so underwhelmed.
en-unannotated-10093	We didn't finish it.
en-unannotated-10094	Sice earlier my VIP points are not increasing and the problem still remains even after upgrade.
en-unannotated-10095	I thought the prices were VERY reasonable for the quality.
en-unannotated-10096	Not sure if it was just for V-Day, but I very much enjoyed his repertoire, which included Accidentally in Love by the Counting Crows and Hedwig's Theme from the Harry Potter films.
en-unannotated-10097	Very few US guests, many Mexicans and folks from other Latino countries.
en-unannotated-10098	Is not a touristy place so it's awesome to be all mixed with locals ..
en-unannotated-10099	You plenty of options around.
en-unannotated-10100	No water in it when we stayed in June.
en-unannotated-10101	When we showed up the man at reception was rude from the beginning, telling us we would have to wait.
en-unannotated-10102	The flame grilled steak, medium-rare, was cooked perfectly.
en-unannotated-10103	The pancakes themselves are fluffy and springy and American-style.
en-unannotated-10104	nice place..
en-unannotated-10105	The staff was helpful, ambiance eclectic and interesting.
en-unannotated-10106	The menu is short, but really beautiful crepes, nicely presented, by a friendly helpful staff.
en-unannotated-10107	Not only because it was a special occasion, but because we chose to stay at Las Alcobas.
en-unannotated-10108	NO!
en-unannotated-10109	I still only paid 35 Euros for a three course delicious farm-to-table meal!
en-unannotated-10110	Best housekeeper I have recently encountered in my many travels, Ms.
en-unannotated-10111	I hardly missed eating meat at all.
en-unannotated-10112	Overall it was cosy and stylish.
en-unannotated-10113	My cafe affogato was smooth and creamy and was to die for!
en-unannotated-10114	The terrace that sold it to us was closed seasonally  but this wasn't expressed on the website.
en-unannotated-10115	Must try!!
en-unannotated-10116	My hotel was a short walk from Temple Bar, so when I arrived in Dublin hungry and tired, I set out to find a restaurant in the area and found the Boxty House on Yelp.
en-unannotated-10117	If you're in the area, definitely worth a stop.
en-unannotated-10118	This bar is tiny but what a great little bar it is!
en-unannotated-10119	The croissants were to die for.
en-unannotated-10120	I had the fish pie which came with a side salad and some organic Chardonnay/ Grenache blend, both were fantastic.
en-unannotated-10121	The restaurant itself is really cute, and we had a nice table near the back where we could kind of see into the kitchen, which is open.
en-unannotated-10122	The server was right when she said the steak itself would be enough for 2 people and we didn't need appetizers.
en-unannotated-10123	Great atmosphere.
en-unannotated-10124	It gets better though.
en-unannotated-10125	This restaurant is right off the old town square.
en-unannotated-10126	The food was absolutely amazing.
en-unannotated-10127	and nice wines al for the right price
en-unannotated-10128	If you are looking for a place to grab a coffee or breakfast in downtown Brisbane, be sure not to miss Brew!
en-unannotated-10129	From the cute décor to attentive staff to the byob policy, everything worked for me and I'm planning a return visit in the very near future.
en-unannotated-10130	We LOVED this meal!
en-unannotated-10131	The valet parking and the waiters are still very good.
en-unannotated-10132	Complimenti.
en-unannotated-10133	İf you are a family of three ask for two connecting rooms instead of triple.
en-unannotated-10134	Naturally, I opted to book with them when I learned they had a location in Mexico City.
en-unannotated-10135	That sounds like a lot of food and it was, the sides are really designed to share.
en-unannotated-10136	This place serves up great coffee and breakfast, but is open all day to keep you fed and watered into the evening.
en-unannotated-10137	i booked the lunch 2 months ago
en-unannotated-10138	The room was very quiet and clean.
en-unannotated-10139	Loved this place!
en-unannotated-10140	I had a perfectly pleasant meal at Boxty House during my recent visit to Dublin.
en-unannotated-10141	I can now see why Miel Container had been on the best burger lists.
en-unannotated-10142	this is it!
en-unannotated-10143	Time to finish my beer while reading a good book.
en-unannotated-10144	Every dish we tried was delicious.
en-unannotated-10145	Enjoy your trip to Paris!
en-unannotated-10146	If you need anything just ask and it's done.
en-unannotated-10147	Every thing was really bad staff room even the balcony was not clean at all and furniture so old and dirty
en-unannotated-10148	He made our dining experience amazing!!!
en-unannotated-10149	WHAT TO TRY?
en-unannotated-10150	We stopped by and were delighted that this place offered to seat us without a reservation.
en-unannotated-10151	The owner was nice.
en-unannotated-10152	It's a family run establishment, the father, the son and I presume other family members as well.
en-unannotated-10153	The chocolate moelleux was a concentration of a chocolate experience with...
en-unannotated-10154	Hotel is understaffed, bathrooms always miss something.
en-unannotated-10155	As you can see, only Asians dine here!
en-unannotated-10156	One of the BEST dining experiences I have ever had.
en-unannotated-10157	What else do you need?
en-unannotated-10158	It's an amazing app.
en-unannotated-10159	All in all it was a great experience and I highly recommend it.
en-unannotated-10160	Our server was very kind, and helped us make our decisions in the end, even though she was surprised we went for 5 dishes for 4 people.
en-unannotated-10161	After 30 min, waiting for my friends to finish their pint, I leave to go to another place to drink, even that they where about to close, but I am sorry I would not wait until I don't know what time to the manager come back to me.
en-unannotated-10162	[name] and [name] are really kind.
en-unannotated-10163	Breakfast was very good with excellent choice of fruits, breads and also a very good cappuccino.
en-unannotated-10164	The restaurant seems to be a former home .
en-unannotated-10165	I was half sure that our reservation got lost in translation and to our pleasant surprise, our name was on the list.
en-unannotated-10166	This place gets 5 stars from me for consistancy, service, flavour and for supporting local artists as a bonus (seriously go check out the art, which is all for sale).
en-unannotated-10167	Didn't stick around for dessert since we wanted to free up the table for the restaurant and were fairly full, but I'm sure it would have been good as well!
en-unannotated-10168	next we knew, we were sampling wines and eating pork knee, pronounced with the K by our now friendly server.
en-unannotated-10169	We were in between meals, so we just...
en-unannotated-10170	Can't wait to go back and bring my friends to taste more ciders.
en-unannotated-10171	The start date of 1198 AD makes it the oldest bar in Dublin (even if not the oldest in Ireland as they claim), and that history is nothing to sneeze at.
en-unannotated-10172	I would definitely come back here.
en-unannotated-10173	A/C in spain doesnt usually get turned on till july so some times it can be a bit hot.
en-unannotated-10174	Quality beans and well made.
en-unannotated-10175	DON'T COME HERE!
en-unannotated-10176	Both the rooms and common areas are beautifully decorated and all furniture is brand new.
en-unannotated-10177	I had a delicious duck confit and escargot.
en-unannotated-10178	The shumai were pointlessly weird.
en-unannotated-10179	Nice starting point, nourish your body and then walk!
en-unannotated-10180	The catch, two beds pushed together!
en-unannotated-10181	We had the goulash in a bread which was excellent and filled the both of us.
en-unannotated-10182	l'immagine Bistrot is a MUST when in Milan.
en-unannotated-10183	The service was great and the food was not bad.
en-unannotated-10184	is that common in Italy?
en-unannotated-10185	The only thing is that the app is a little bit slow.
en-unannotated-10186	Went for their degustation lunch.
en-unannotated-10187	I've also heard they open late some evenings for drinks, but I've yet to make it in for that.
en-unannotated-10188	Please do something for this issue
en-unannotated-10189	Came here one night for dinner on my own.
en-unannotated-10190	Ordered this both nights.
en-unannotated-10191	Pros:
en-unannotated-10192	drawers wouldn't close....
en-unannotated-10193	might be just me
en-unannotated-10194	Everything about this hotel exceeded our expectations!
en-unannotated-10195	Although not in the dead centre of Sn Sebastián the hotel is within easy walking distance of the town and all it has to offer.
en-unannotated-10196	We found out that presidents of other nations frequently stay here because it is the most secure hotel in DF.
en-unannotated-10197	The hotel was very clean and the staff was friendly.
en-unannotated-10198	We sat upstairs and enjoyed the cool breeze lofting through the open window.
en-unannotated-10199	Some things never change.
en-unannotated-10200	Very nice staff.
en-unannotated-10201	We chose the 10 course degustation menu and most of them were pretty interesting!
en-unannotated-10202	After a few raviolis, the heavy sauce had me really full already.
en-unannotated-10203	The people working here makes you feel very welcome.
en-unannotated-10204	Cooked perfectly, garnished without fuss, and in portions that seem tailored to your stomach.
en-unannotated-10205	Quiet location, great views.
en-unannotated-10206	The food was pricey but divine.
en-unannotated-10207	Needs updated version with Google cast feature so mammy can watch Corrie on the telly.
en-unannotated-10208	The rooms were spotlessly clean and we loved the breakfast left on your door handle.
en-unannotated-10209	Her demeanor was clipped and harried, but what do you expect from a person who is running around like a tasmanian devil?
en-unannotated-10210	The portions are ample but don't turn you off.
en-unannotated-10211	After a 2" thick Rump (I know, it defies all the text books) was placed in front of me, I understand why French chefs refuse to...
en-unannotated-10212	The rooms were rather small, and the bathroom somewhat old-fashioned.
en-unannotated-10213	Verizon service so connection is good.
en-unannotated-10214	It was rich but the flavors melded perfectly.
en-unannotated-10215	This place is very conveniently located and has everything a visitor might need.
en-unannotated-10216	Great staff, location, room and comfort.
en-unannotated-10217	Coat your stomach with a boxty and then hit the town for a night of drinking and dancing!
en-unannotated-10218	We sat upstairs which was more lively and fun.
en-unannotated-10219	I was in sweet heaven..
en-unannotated-10220	The food was the equivalent of food and ambiance in the U.S to that of a diner.
en-unannotated-10221	Breakfast room is very small and as a lactose intolerant it was extremely poor.
en-unannotated-10222	there was no pretension.
en-unannotated-10223	We ( a couple) went for a launch based on the superb recommendation...
en-unannotated-10224	I'm honestly perplexed by the positive reviews of this pastry shop.
en-unannotated-10225	It's true, the pizza is really Italian, fire-wood oven, as italian as possible ingredients, italian pizzaiolo...
en-unannotated-10226	I had one day in the city to eat so I wanted to test a few things.
en-unannotated-10227	For dinners, we ordered the chicken fillet, which was very tender and tasty and served with a Lemmon-butter and rosemary sauce.
en-unannotated-10228	Lovely fresh orange juice.
en-unannotated-10229	There is lots of meat, salad, vegies and sauce.
en-unannotated-10230	Creamy, yet the onions and toppings made it sweet and savory.
en-unannotated-10231	Why is it that 5 stars hotels only ever supply one shower cap when there are two guests?
en-unannotated-10232	It is just old aged hotel, since they dont spend anything for renovation in hotel.
en-unannotated-10233	We were in Italia for Christ sake!
en-unannotated-10234	Note that this place is definitely better than the typical restaurant.
en-unannotated-10235	After visiting we both decided that perhaps we should have rethought coming to Prague.....
en-unannotated-10236	Food well prepared and spiced at its point, fair portions the place does not stand out for its atmosphere, they believe that serving in ALUMINUM pots gives them a touch, but what it gives is sadness due to what we all know about this food...
en-unannotated-10237	guys the hotel looks old and musty....
en-unannotated-10238	From outside looks small and quaint, but inside its much bigger and very modern decor.
en-unannotated-10239	There's a bar that's to your right and a large, colorful tree that's painted on the left side wall.
en-unannotated-10240	From the Cardinal Lemoine metro stop, I wandered.
en-unannotated-10241	The food is truly amazing.
en-unannotated-10242	LAST TIP?
en-unannotated-10243	... and I'll say it again.
en-unannotated-10244	Would like to try A quest but all these thousand ones from ONE uninstalled game in theway..
en-unannotated-10245	We were in Dublin for a soccer tournament.
en-unannotated-10246	Transportation was accessible to all places.
en-unannotated-10247	Le Potager de Pere Thierry was definitely the best French food I had in Paris, and it was actually one of the highlights of our trip.
en-unannotated-10248	This meal was extremely satisfying, and I wouldn't hesitate to come back again during a future trip.
en-unannotated-10249	Amazing!
en-unannotated-10250	It has a wicked selection of craft beer and decent foodmenu.
en-unannotated-10251	Is that it won't update, idk if it's my phone and/Or Wi-Fi.
en-unannotated-10252	A treat to yourself in San Sebastián
en-unannotated-10253	The fish and chips were simply perfect - one of, if not the best, I've ever had.
en-unannotated-10254	Excellent food!!
en-unannotated-10255	After you eat here you will try to befriend me on yelp.
en-unannotated-10256	Try a small cake with the chocolate, you will come back for it !
en-unannotated-10257	Very good location.
en-unannotated-10258	Very nice from him to come out from a busy night to talk with me and after the explanation he left saying to me to give him one minute where he would come back.
en-unannotated-10259	But I dont see that as being a significant problem because the food meets up with the high reviews.
en-unannotated-10260	Good food.
en-unannotated-10261	Great for breakfast in a very good location.
en-unannotated-10262	He got us a table for two within a half hour.
en-unannotated-10263	The pancakes were so delicious and not too overly sweet.
en-unannotated-10264	The staff was lovely.
en-unannotated-10265	We stayed at the Doubletree nearby and it was a quick walk to here.
en-unannotated-10266	Great friendly service.
en-unannotated-10267	The atmosphere is suitable for dating,...
en-unannotated-10268	Around a 3-5 minute walk from the beach, 15-20 minutes from the busy end of the beach with all the bars & restaurants.
en-unannotated-10269	The service is good, as you would expect from a restaurant in this neighborhood.
en-unannotated-10270	I regret that we didn´t eat here twice as the other places were double the price with way worse service.
en-unannotated-10271	And if that's not enough, you can always throw in some extras like avocado, an egg or an extra pattie.
en-unannotated-10272	Coffee is their own blend from their roastery Little Brew in Paddington.
en-unannotated-10273	Tinder team is worse than useless and copies and pastes totally unrelated "solutions" from their FAQs to answer you.
en-unannotated-10274	What can I say?
en-unannotated-10275	Steak is a must.
en-unannotated-10276	Prices here are little bit steep but worth if if you want to splurge on a night out with good company.
en-unannotated-10277	If any criticism restaurant got uncomfortably hot on a warm summer day in the back tables.
en-unannotated-10278	Cost was very affordable and food was exceptional.
en-unannotated-10279	The service is perfect.
en-unannotated-10280	Service was very good, especially because it was so small, you can't miss us asking for more drinks.
en-unannotated-10281	If it is a relaxing, Boutique hotel you desire in the Historic Centre of Mexxio City , then this is your hotel .
en-unannotated-10282	No account balance shown either.
en-unannotated-10283	If you want a nice meal then this is the place for you!
en-unannotated-10284	You definitely have to pay for the experience and quality, but my wife and I have never had such...
en-unannotated-10285	My girlfriend and I will certainly come back.
en-unannotated-10286	Great food and enjoyed talking with the chef while he prepared and cooked the meal.
en-unannotated-10287	Location to landmarks, food, and shopping.
en-unannotated-10288	Juicy steak burger!
en-unannotated-10289	I willed haven't heard of this message is prohibited and may contain the same time, I have a good day, but the fact, it will take you up with you, I have to go.
en-unannotated-10290	We were looking for an 'off the mall' place for breakfast and came across Brew not far from our hotel.
en-unannotated-10291	Ordered Ajiaco which is a Colombian chiquen soup and my friend ordered Ajiaco recommended by the waiter and they were both great!
en-unannotated-10292	Took a chance on booking with the website and was not disappointed.
en-unannotated-10293	So Have fun.
en-unannotated-10294	We have only had breakfast here, but it was wonderful every time.
en-unannotated-10295	Filled with regulars, it's one of the few places I had to wait in line, the food is worth it.
en-unannotated-10296	The event was a gastronomic journey through the history of Barcelona, with a...
en-unannotated-10297	Highly
en-unannotated-10298	Dublin, it seems like a requirement to eat at the oldest pub in said city.
en-unannotated-10299	They could work a little bit on their interacting with the customer.
en-unannotated-10300	It's so nice here.
en-unannotated-10301	Would definitely come back for the main dishes.
en-unannotated-10302	I forget what all we ordered, but I did have the very delicious broccoli dish and some excellent truffle fries, as well as some rosemary polenta which was out of this world yummy.
en-unannotated-10303	I dont eat pork but that damn pork knuckle marinated beer looks divine and it's HUGE.
en-unannotated-10304	Associated with Bunker by the Milton train station, John Mills Himself has established itself as one of the best, if not the best coffee stop in the city.
en-unannotated-10305	And there were three wait staff.
en-unannotated-10306	Outstanding suites (expect nothing less of Embassy Suites)
en-unannotated-10307	I had the little pizza crust triangles with dips and the house olives that would be fantastic in a dirty martini.
en-unannotated-10308	The only let down that night was the service.
en-unannotated-10309	Rooms
en-unannotated-10310	Thanks for the recommendation [NAME]!
en-unannotated-10311	Each bite was pure heaven, and was washed down perfectly with the crisp beer we had.
en-unannotated-10312	One of the best chocolate I've ever had!
en-unannotated-10313	We went to El Minibar for lunch, following the recommendations on TA.
en-unannotated-10314	As you expect from NH very smart, well appointed rooms- welcome drinks in the lobby a nice touch plus more than you could possibly eat for breakfast- recommended- a little far out from town tho' 30 minute walk to old town
en-unannotated-10315	The food was fresh, comforting and delicious.
en-unannotated-10316	Call in advance if you want to get a good seat and if you're eating dinner, make sure you tell them to see if they have a spot upstairs.
en-unannotated-10317	We were pretty happy to find out we came to a great restaurant!
en-unannotated-10318	Reasonable prices - great service - group of nine sat in the private room just of the main dining room - it was snug but provided a quite(r) place to connect and enjoy the wonderful meal.
en-unannotated-10319	We got seated fairly quick and got a tall table near the bar.
en-unannotated-10320	All around a great app.
en-unannotated-10321	We couldn't get enough of the amazing draft selections and the flavors in our meals.
en-unannotated-10322	Lunchy snack and excellent macaroons.
en-unannotated-10323	Would never of walked into this basement restaurant off of the street - so thanks yelpers!
en-unannotated-10324	The hotel is a 1.
en-unannotated-10325	The local house wines were lackluster and predictably more expensive than local wines outside of Prague 1. They had one interesting beer on tap, but it was only listed on a specials board at the front of the restaurant and we weren't told about it, so we didn't see it until we left.
en-unannotated-10326	It just didn't live up to all the wonderful reviews.
en-unannotated-10327	Excellent welcome by the owners.
en-unannotated-10328	I am not an expert in pasta whatsoever.
en-unannotated-10329	Finally, the lava cake was to die for.
en-unannotated-10330	Took the team out to dinner.
en-unannotated-10331	His dish was good but mine was the winner.
en-unannotated-10332	Why is it even available outside Ireland if it doesn't work.
en-unannotated-10333	Fantastic evening in a very intimate small restaurant that has only five tables.
en-unannotated-10334	Deleted now.
en-unannotated-10335	Buffet breakfast and big double-bed room.
en-unannotated-10336	Rude and unfriendly!
en-unannotated-10337	Location not far from the Columbus Zoo.
en-unannotated-10338	The soup and pasta we had was absolutely delicious.
en-unannotated-10339	Found this place after watching the well-known Honest Guide to Prague series on Youtube.
en-unannotated-10340	Amazing service.
en-unannotated-10341	My darling friends ordered a "Feast". Truly, it's all in the name: Rosemary Lamb with cumin sauce went a long way!
en-unannotated-10342	- lamb: 5/5. Very potent lamb smell but delicious nonetheless
en-unannotated-10343	Within walking distance, along the seafront(15mins), of old town and its numerous tapas (pinxtos) bars.
en-unannotated-10344	Definitely a delight to my palette :)
en-unannotated-10345	Hotel stay was great!
en-unannotated-10346	Eat here.
en-unannotated-10347	Users and taxi drivers of Barcelona are very disappointed.
en-unannotated-10348	I eat lunch here fairly regularly as Casa de Tono in Zona Rosa is only a short walk from the office.
en-unannotated-10349	Everything was incredible, from the design to the cleanliness to the service.
en-unannotated-10350	The service is excellent.
en-unannotated-10351	Some clever design cues include a butter knife that stands upright but the table layout is practical rather than fussy,...
en-unannotated-10352	I have been fortunate to visit John Mills in the day for a coffee, and in the evening for a cocktail.
en-unannotated-10353	The server was genuine and even made us laugh a few times closing out an undebatable five star experience.
en-unannotated-10354	Price was high (€16 for that burger) but I guess that's standard for Dublin.
en-unannotated-10355	The ones they are making are out of this world.
en-unannotated-10356	The restaurant area isn't huge but there is room for several tables of varying sizes as well as some comfortable looking booths.
en-unannotated-10357	I've expected more.
en-unannotated-10358	Sticky date pudding in the best ever caramel sauce
en-unannotated-10359	The restaurant is on a side street.
en-unannotated-10360	I will give them the benefit of being only open open a week or so and I will be back as I love the idea.
en-unannotated-10361	I wasn't originally planning on getting the escargot but when it came out to the table next to is, smelling all delicious I couldn't help but order it.
en-unannotated-10362	I like the location, bathroom,
en-unannotated-10363	great app does what it say on the tin
en-unannotated-10364	Haven't done it yet, but in the next few days I sure as hell am.
en-unannotated-10365	The crab cakes were crunchy and paired with a lovely red sauce that had a bit of spice.
en-unannotated-10366	The service was outstanding!
en-unannotated-10367	With a very creative chef, a sous chef and a server this gem is serves you one of the best fixed menu with wine pairing we have had in a long time....
en-unannotated-10368	The language barrier was a little bit embarrassing for us, I wished so much to be able to speak to them fully beyond the Grazie, preggo, buono, etc.
en-unannotated-10369	[NAME] and [NAME] were very friendly and made all of us relax and enjoying time together.
en-unannotated-10370	but i'll make the same.
en-unannotated-10371	The menu had me guessing as the items could be a bit more descriptive (but perhaps that adds to the air of mystery?).
en-unannotated-10372	Great beer.
en-unannotated-10373	Encore!!!
en-unannotated-10374	Sometimes it's the unplanned nights that turn out to be the best.
en-unannotated-10375	The food came out hot which I LOVE.
en-unannotated-10376	The location was incredible.
en-unannotated-10377	The sons have taken over after the passing of the father and they maintain a high standard in terms of local cuisine.
en-unannotated-10378	Place is nice and the waiters are very friendly, but somehow the selection of food and bouquet of tastes lags behind.
en-unannotated-10379	Which is a nuisance
en-unannotated-10380	I was a little ambivalent given the price point and not all glowing reviews.
en-unannotated-10381	That place is awesome!!
en-unannotated-10382	So I went in and was not disappointed.
en-unannotated-10383	We loved the duck with orange sauce as well as the sirloin served with foie.
en-unannotated-10384	It's laggy, you can't edit your profile, you can't edit playlists, songs will skip at certain parts, certain songs will get stuck at certain parts and just repeat, and very often the first second of a song will repeat itself once at the beginning.
en-unannotated-10385	This is good fun, incredibly addictive but is entirely dependent on the online game.
en-unannotated-10386	Have also been here on a Saturday night for a birthday with a crowd and service was attentive and efficient even when the restaurant was busy.
en-unannotated-10387	You sit at some annoying tables where you cannot stretch legs.
en-unannotated-10388	Service was also very good.
en-unannotated-10389	Breakfast was weak for a Hampton.
en-unannotated-10390	For instance, I ordered the Vegetarian sashimi and instead of the usual little rolls I am so used to, I got small packed balls of rice drenched in soy sauce and eggplant flavour, or topped with pickled radish and spring onion, or a giant mushroom top carved into a flower!
en-unannotated-10391	I don't write reviews but this place deserves it.
en-unannotated-10392	My other daughter and husband also got it.
en-unannotated-10393	It's fine, but why the pop-up asking if I'm sure I want to exit?
en-unannotated-10394	One star less only because search is setup automaticly for best match instead of newest as should be.
en-unannotated-10395	Early Dinner/late lunch on my own.
en-unannotated-10396	Doesn't actually stream television.
en-unannotated-10397	She accepted our request with very little advance notice and presented beautiful, healthy, delicious, vegetarian food to meat eaters with love and joy.
en-unannotated-10398	Yes, they do serve an amazing quantity of food.
en-unannotated-10399	Excellent location, at 200 meters walk of Plaza Espana.
en-unannotated-10400	Tasted as if they were marinated in beer.
en-unannotated-10401	Very friendly, welcoming and funny in a good way;-) Compliment!
en-unannotated-10402	Yuri our Milanese born waiter guided through the menu.
en-unannotated-10403	The name of the restaurant was Peklo, which we later learned means "Hell.
en-unannotated-10404	Highly recommend!!!
en-unannotated-10405	Room attendant service is good and respectful of the "Privacy Please" signage.
en-unannotated-10406	My friend needed help in selecting gluten free dishes and the waiter was available to check everything in the kitchen.
en-unannotated-10407	The mains are pretty reasonably priced, but the entrees are also rather amazing.
en-unannotated-10408	Hotel is clean, modern and comfortable.
en-unannotated-10409	The food is fantastic.
en-unannotated-10410	My pancakes were very tasty with plenty of bacon and avocado.
en-unannotated-10411	Great hosts.
en-unannotated-10412	They have a very drinkable and tasty Westons cider on tap along with a selection of 60+ ciders to satisfy the most avid cider fan.
en-unannotated-10413	So the emphasis must be on the food, I thought.
en-unannotated-10414	I wanted very much to like this restaurant but found it just ok.
en-unannotated-10415	The atmosphere is loud and boisterous, one shares the tables with complete strangers and the space is limited.
en-unannotated-10416	Meat is so fresh.
en-unannotated-10417	Lobby is spectacular to see and grand staircase amazing
en-unannotated-10418	We had dinner at the small but effective restaurant in the hotel & food was delicious.
en-unannotated-10419	Warm and welcoming, the folks here made me feel right at home,. House red was good and inexpensive.
en-unannotated-10420	During the summer you must grab an iced coffee from their fridge, freshly brewed right here in Brisbane.
en-unannotated-10421	Experienced traveler and familiar with the W hotels in the Americas.
en-unannotated-10422	I had a steak and it was prepared perfectly.
en-unannotated-10423	I come to Mexico City often and usually stay in Polanco, but this time we decided that staying in Centro Histórico would e more interesting.
en-unannotated-10424	The servings are quite sizeable too so you could share if you wanted to.
en-unannotated-10425	This is a 2 star hotel because of the smallish plain rooms, slightly rough sheets and only moderately comfortable beds.
en-unannotated-10426	That goat cheese cream with the cherry tomatoes!
en-unannotated-10427	While this is a really solid platformer (impressive for essentially only having one single jump button), this game needs a better endgame.
en-unannotated-10428	They were both really good and the iced coffee drip came on a cute platter.
en-unannotated-10429	However, it seemed like most people were ordering food rather than just meat to bring home and cook, so I do wish they had at least a few more chairs.
en-unannotated-10430	I could have sent back but it wasn't that big of a deal.
en-unannotated-10431	but I was wrong!!
en-unannotated-10432	Both came with a side of pommes frites.
en-unannotated-10433	I loved the flavor of the pork belly.
en-unannotated-10434	The price for a 14 fixed menu is absolutely unbelievable.
en-unannotated-10435	I tried chicken enchiladas with mole sauce.
en-unannotated-10436	from the hotel to the nearest Metro Tribunal Station on Line 1 & 10.
en-unannotated-10437	Yep, this coffee shop classes things up in the evening with bow-tie donning bartenders ready to mix up something delicious.
en-unannotated-10438	Nothing pretentious, just simple food with excellent ingredients and prepared perfectly.
en-unannotated-10439	On a short trip to Madrid we decided to have dinner at this restaurant on the basis of the various reviews we had read.
en-unannotated-10440	I made an enquiry about a cocktail price (knowing this was a cider house), only to have it show up at the table and I was stuck paying; it tasted horrible to boot.
en-unannotated-10441	It's a hidden hipster gem.
en-unannotated-10442	And the bed was fabulous.
en-unannotated-10443	As promised came back the next night for dinner with the wife.
en-unannotated-10444	My partner ordered chili, which was a strange chili with avocado, pico de Gallo, and rice in a baked tortilla bowl.
en-unannotated-10445	Rooms were clean, comfortable and well eqipped.
en-unannotated-10446	We went here not knowing what to expect and it was awesome!
en-unannotated-10447	Once we were seated our server (who also happened to be the host), who spoke very good English, waited on us in an extremely quick manner.
en-unannotated-10448	But let's back the bus up and start with the starters.
en-unannotated-10449	Excellent if you're looking for a beer hall with simple Czech food like sausages and soup.
en-unannotated-10450	Due to unforeseen circumstances, my partner ended up in hospital in Bogata for 3 days.
en-unannotated-10451	After staying at many Hilton properties, I must say this is one of the better Hilton Garden Inns.
en-unannotated-10452	Thank you
en-unannotated-10453	I go out often in Dublin, I know many bouncers and I know that if I would have drunk a little bit excessively I would agree and don't argue.
en-unannotated-10454	Instead, We returned to Mincovna for a 2nd time, where the food is great and service is friendly.
en-unannotated-10455	Warm welcome.
en-unannotated-10456	Wine is excellent chosen for the courses
en-unannotated-10457	Tiny, tiny place that is run by the chef and his nephew.
en-unannotated-10458	What world is this!?
en-unannotated-10459	We like that they have a little bar in the lobby to have a glass of wine before we go to bed.
en-unannotated-10460	Lovely staff
en-unannotated-10461	The meatloaf, hamburgers, and tartare are all delicious - I haven't tried the sausages, but they always look and smell amazing.
en-unannotated-10462	Accompanied by steamed crunchy snow pea and perfectly roasted new potatoes.
en-unannotated-10463	Interesting.
en-unannotated-10464	Marcio made us a really rich coffee, he also explained about the process and how he makes the coffee taste good, and how the coffee is roasted.
en-unannotated-10465	THIS IS NOT A 5 STARS, STAY AWAY!
en-unannotated-10466	18 covers...
en-unannotated-10467	It was beautiful.
en-unannotated-10468	The bread was more like toast (we, being from Paris, were expecting baguettes). Menu read marmalade of choice but we were given a berry jam.
en-unannotated-10469	Prices are not so expensive.
en-unannotated-10470	I didn't have much expectation for the cinnamon and butter ones because it sounded so simple, but it was delicious!
en-unannotated-10471	I would be here every week if I lived here.
en-unannotated-10472	The service is wanting - not enough servers, very bad organisation table-wise.
en-unannotated-10473	This means you can control your own pour, which is nice.
en-unannotated-10474	Waking up a little after lunch after my first night in Paris, this was my first meal and it was a winner thanks to Yelp.
en-unannotated-10475	One our best dining experiences in Italy.
en-unannotated-10476	I went due to a good rating from TripAdvisor.
en-unannotated-10477	The reputation of this hotel is truly deserved.
en-unannotated-10478	Seafood was over-cooked and not fresh.
en-unannotated-10479	If you are craving mexican food you must visit this place, they have multiple locations around Mexico City so I suggest visiting the nearest one to you, you will not regret it.
en-unannotated-10480	My husband and I absolutely love this place.
en-unannotated-10481	Wonderful service.
en-unannotated-10482	HI B
en-unannotated-10483	I can even feel that smell of freshly prepared steak when close my eyes.
en-unannotated-10484	Big plus that you can get everything on the menu gluten free.
en-unannotated-10485	but the atmosphere is good so spending a few extra minutes is no trouble.
en-unannotated-10486	Self service, very good food (I understand it cooks like in the usual Russian households), in the environment of the best mall, in the heart of Moscow / Red Square....
en-unannotated-10487	Food: I had a great ocean fish that was blinded by the over breaded crust.
en-unannotated-10488	To the point where we could barely even finish a shared dessert (which was a mirabelle crumble that was good, not great), or the little cakes they gave us with our espressos.
en-unannotated-10489	The location, which overlooks the city and the bay on one side and the ocean and the cliffs on the other.
en-unannotated-10490	keeps turnin off whhile tryin to open programme
en-unannotated-10491	There was hot water, and the front desk staff spoke English.
en-unannotated-10492	Hugo was also kind, offering explanations on some of the things he was preparing.
en-unannotated-10493	I am a big, big fan of potato gnocchi, and I find a good gnocchi at a decent price hard to come by.
en-unannotated-10494	Lastly, staff qualification and interest is very lower, there is no customer relations policy.
en-unannotated-10495	Then they gave us large bottles of candies to sample.
en-unannotated-10496	It's basically like savory crepe, except the pancake is made out of potato.
en-unannotated-10497	Gave us$100 off a $450 lunch.
en-unannotated-10498	This was good, it was very inexpensive and open 24 hours.
en-unannotated-10499	Please try again later.
en-unannotated-10500	A simple 'Sunday dinner' type of menu presented itself which usually leaves me stone cold but the good people behind The Farm use only locally sourced, organic produce which made all the difference.
en-unannotated-10501	It was a great evening for sure but we suspect our menu options on a different evening may have led to a more enthusiastic 5!
en-unannotated-10502	A taste of Russia's Soviet past.
en-unannotated-10503	Tiramisu: served in a tea cup, home made and honestly believe me when I have eaten Tiramisu all over Italy and this was the best I have ever had.
en-unannotated-10504	The place was very busy and the staff seemed harried and short tempered.
en-unannotated-10505	The downside is the very tight seating.
en-unannotated-10506	Very cozy and the staff were super warm and welcoming.
en-unannotated-10507	We even got to see [NAME] peeking out from the kitchen and teased no some guests.
en-unannotated-10508	For its unique complex dishes and prompt attentive service, L'Estrapade comes out as a far better value than the many crowded bistros/brasseries that serve bland formulaic food at similar prices.
en-unannotated-10509	They were very nice and let us know when reservations were coming.
en-unannotated-10510	The cheese and bacon toppings are beyond good.
en-unannotated-10511	More choices, more options, and more expensive (but still a very good deal). We chose to each do the 5 course small plate menu each paired with 1/2 glass of wine for 54 Euro.
en-unannotated-10512	Excellent food and service!
en-unannotated-10513	I've  been using  Donedeal since 2009, and I find it very good in all aspects.
en-unannotated-10514	The food and the ingredients were of the best quality and taste.
en-unannotated-10515	The service is what really made it exceptional!
en-unannotated-10516	It was spacious, clean and had all the amenities you would need.
en-unannotated-10517	Thanks for a wonderfull stay in Rome
en-unannotated-10518	All were phenomenal.
en-unannotated-10519	They also forgot that I had ordered something else which I was looking forward to.
en-unannotated-10520	We felt safe the entire time.
en-unannotated-10521	Very vary menu but of course you need to be careful about the spicy food.
en-unannotated-10522	The prices are remarkably low.
en-unannotated-10523	The restaurant was obviously quiet when we arrived but by the time we left, the majority of tables were filled, which is quite impressive for a Tuesday night!
en-unannotated-10524	Love the updates, only thing is that I just lost all of the points I made this week due to an update.
en-unannotated-10525	And we have not been disappointed.
en-unannotated-10526	This place has a fantastic atmosphere, great for an outing with colleagues or just hanging out with friends.
en-unannotated-10527	I order the half shell scallop.
en-unannotated-10528	Great service, amazing food and fair prices
en-unannotated-10529	The hotel exceed our expectations in all aspects.
en-unannotated-10530	Very tasty food with wonderful service so pop in when you're nearby !
en-unannotated-10531	Look no further, no lie.
en-unannotated-10532	staff great...
en-unannotated-10533	Food was delicious, with a vast choice of burgers and...
en-unannotated-10534	It was ok not amazing...
en-unannotated-10535	Craving for decent burger?
en-unannotated-10536	My husband and I were on our honeymoon.
en-unannotated-10537	impossible to sleep beacuse of  noise as windows are 5 decades old ( no isoşation ) .
en-unannotated-10538	Mashed potatoes creamy and buttery and the asparagus done right.
en-unannotated-10539	I had the beefsteak with pepper sauce and my friend had the veal (I would recommend the pepper sauce for this meal as it's kinda dry). The preparation has the feel of something a family member would make for you- not fancy, but very homey and comforting.
en-unannotated-10540	The mushroom entree was great - a variety of mushrooms in a creamy sauce w/ Gorgonzola.
en-unannotated-10541	I could even go further and compare to Sushi master chef who have hundreds of hours in training and meticulously cut fish to manipulate its taste and texture to the nth degree.
en-unannotated-10542	Our family of 8 enjoyed delectable meal that was served in a spectacular presentation !
en-unannotated-10543	The lamb that is good for 10 hours was amazing didn't need a knife to cut it.
en-unannotated-10544	We got lucky and got an open high top.
en-unannotated-10545	This place is HORRIBLE!!!
en-unannotated-10546	That's the place!
en-unannotated-10547	Lovely boutique hotel in a fabulous location.
en-unannotated-10548	I will definitely come here again my last night before heading back to Cali!
en-unannotated-10549	So flavorful and a huge portion is served.
en-unannotated-10550	When I was up in Brisbane, I was told by a fellow blogger that Sake was THE restaurant to try!
en-unannotated-10551	Un excelente lugar para comer y disfrutar un buen corte.
en-unannotated-10552	Cabbage stew
en-unannotated-10553	Reception representitives are rude!
en-unannotated-10554	In short, generous portions, genuine and friendly service, warm and cosy atmosphere.
en-unannotated-10555	The service was perfect and he chose a great bottle of red wine to accompany our meal.
en-unannotated-10556	It is in a very safe area with open spaces opposite.
en-unannotated-10557	I would highly recommend L'Estrapade anyone seeking a cozy dinner for two in the city of lights.
en-unannotated-10558	taxis where grate and personal in general.
en-unannotated-10559	Everyone was so nice and willing to help.
en-unannotated-10560	Absolutely amazing.
en-unannotated-10561	A true hidden gem.
en-unannotated-10562	Adds of amazon and I dont what what games....
en-unannotated-10563	Anything you order not available will be charged on your room and is overpriced.
en-unannotated-10564	First night in Italy and we saw the reviews for this restaurant.
en-unannotated-10565	Hardly busy.
en-unannotated-10566	This was not haute-cuisine, but is was rustic French cooking--hot cheesy goodness.
en-unannotated-10567	Snails are lovely (if you like snails, turns out that I don't), beef was delightful and French onion soup was delicious.
en-unannotated-10568	Will definitely go back next time we are in Rome.
en-unannotated-10569	There was good choice on the menu.
en-unannotated-10570	Well worth the trip.
en-unannotated-10571	The lobby is the only highlight of this place - terrible room, experience & staff.
en-unannotated-10572	The Lagunitas IPA also looks fantastic might I add.
en-unannotated-10573	No complaints
en-unannotated-10574	Tried to give us a different room to what we paid for - TERRIBLE rooms were shown to us, 4th room was acceptable.
en-unannotated-10575	This is unusual, especially at lunch time in France!
en-unannotated-10576	The food was authentic, the staff was friendly and personable.
en-unannotated-10577	We came here for dinner on a Sunday evening, a difficult day to find a good restaurant open.
en-unannotated-10578	Room was freshly renovated with a clean lines/modern design.
en-unannotated-10579	Two restaurants with good food and service reasonably priced.
en-unannotated-10580	the oatmeal and the sirinki are also very fine.
en-unannotated-10581	The Korean BBQ Bugolgi beef burger from Miel Container is that for me.
en-unannotated-10582	10/10 would recommand this restaurant and 10/10 would eat here again.
en-unannotated-10583	This hotel room was very minimalist almost to the point of the room feeling undercoated.
en-unannotated-10584	And be sure to make reservations!
en-unannotated-10585	Wooden wine box walls and the tiles were a nice finish.
en-unannotated-10586	The co-owner, who looks like...
en-unannotated-10587	Here from Phoenix, AZ!
en-unannotated-10588	Crowded place because small, nice cooking, no view over the harbor not Bonifacio but quick to eat.
en-unannotated-10589	The starters were not fantastic, but the wonderful service more than made up for it.
en-unannotated-10590	See you again soon, Survey Co.
en-unannotated-10591	The hotel looks modern, the rooms were clean, and the staff were all extremely friendly & helpful.
en-unannotated-10592	The duck liver patty was served with wheat bread and caramelized sweat pearl onion (I couldn't get enough of it). My main course, the duck thigh, was deliciously placed over pickled cabbage, and topped with thinly sliced fried onion.
en-unannotated-10593	Both entrees were tres tres bon!
en-unannotated-10594	If you are looking for fish and chips look somewhere else.....
en-unannotated-10595	The staff (one person to seat and serve customers) had plenty of recommendations and excellent English (very accommodating).
en-unannotated-10596	We spent about $90 for for people with drinks and two courses.
en-unannotated-10597	Possibly the best steak ever and very reasonable price
en-unannotated-10598	With establishments also in Sydney and Melbourne, Saké is at the forefront of modern, creative stylings of traditional Japanese cuisine.
en-unannotated-10599	But the waitress said nothing available...
en-unannotated-10600	Nothing around and very noisy.
en-unannotated-10601	Pastas are 100% made in house.
en-unannotated-10602	In fact, this was the best darn bagel sandwich that I have ever eaten, and I order bagel sandwiches quite a bit.
en-unannotated-10603	No plates in the apartment, almost no toilet paper.
en-unannotated-10604	We went back to try the 12-hour braised pork rump.
en-unannotated-10605	I was also pretty surprised by his skills, as he was the only waiter in the restaurant and still managed to attend to every table well.
en-unannotated-10606	Super friendly service and awesome food.
en-unannotated-10607	Windows are very old with big chinks and cracks, permanent noise of outside.
en-unannotated-10608	Think a better rice pudding and flavorful cake.....
en-unannotated-10609	unbeatable location, friendly service
en-unannotated-10610	The food was great, no complaints!
en-unannotated-10611	Both were prepared perfectly and delicious!
en-unannotated-10612	Sooo good.
en-unannotated-10613	A definite stop off for lunch if in the area
en-unannotated-10614	To be recommended!
en-unannotated-10615	I always liked what I ended up getting.
en-unannotated-10616	Excellent waitress.
en-unannotated-10617	The staff was extremely friendly and everything was very clean.
en-unannotated-10618	We were given Prosecco upon arrival.
en-unannotated-10619	And when l ask what time should l come back , no answer !
en-unannotated-10620	Concierge
en-unannotated-10621	You can order sides from the dinner menu for lunch if you need more.
en-unannotated-10622	They explained to me any questions I had regarding food and wine.
en-unannotated-10623	The hosts were very understanding and...
en-unannotated-10624	The breakfast buffet is to die for and a la carte menu for lunch and dinner at The Market is excellent as well.
en-unannotated-10625	It's a shot of some type of peppermint flavored alcohol....
en-unannotated-10626	My husband and I are visiting Milan from the states and found this gem of a place for a late night dinner.
en-unannotated-10627	This game is good for really long trips.
en-unannotated-10628	We shared an order of the boxty fries.
en-unannotated-10629	The extra serve of onion rings was 4 huge rings of crispy fried battered onion.
en-unannotated-10630	Way too many adds puts me off using it
en-unannotated-10631	I would recommend this hotel, it was good value for the money
en-unannotated-10632	It took 10 minutes to get a menu and wine list, and only after we flagged down the waiter.
en-unannotated-10633	I guess that as a vegetable-lover I shouldn't be eating in a Czech restaurant, but when the meat also isn't good, you won't convince me.
en-unannotated-10634	If you're looking for a light meal I would stay away from their entrees.
en-unannotated-10635	It was served with scrumptious soda bread.
en-unannotated-10636	Food was a pleasant surprise.
en-unannotated-10637	Hardly a place to sit.
en-unannotated-10638	Facilities are beautiful and clean.
en-unannotated-10639	Good place to have a good taste of different ways of cooking paella.
en-unannotated-10640	Perfect brunch with a big variety of food.
en-unannotated-10641	I really love when a restaurant gets innovative and plays around with different flavors.
en-unannotated-10642	Everything was newly renovated, modern, and clean.
en-unannotated-10643	We walked maybe 4 minutes down a couple of unassuming streets and alleyways and arrived
en-unannotated-10644	and beer.
en-unannotated-10645	The flavors are spectacular (indescribable) the service impeccably gracious, the presentation pure artistry.
en-unannotated-10646	Started with the cabbage soup and beer.
en-unannotated-10647	It was a quaint and cozy place to stop in for a couple of drinks and to listen to some good live Irish music!
en-unannotated-10648	I am so sad we didn't find this place sooner, as we were only able to enjoy it once during our trip!
en-unannotated-10649	Works well.
en-unannotated-10650	And if you can not figure it out you could use a hint.
en-unannotated-10651	Yelp was not wrong at all!
en-unannotated-10652	Understand they work basis on reservation for lunch and dinner...
en-unannotated-10653	Have stayed at this BW for one week and have found the location to be perfect and the staff to be friendly and helpful.
en-unannotated-10654	It is perfectly located between the Plaza de la Revolution and the Zocalo.
en-unannotated-10655	Service , food quality , taste , freshness, innovation ....
en-unannotated-10656	No fresh fruits ,No hard cheese ,no good bakery items ,hot course was not rich .
en-unannotated-10657	Decided to use some points and stay at the Residence Inn.
en-unannotated-10658	Although it's a good game, it has some glitches.
en-unannotated-10659	We stayed in room 12 which was previously slated in another review but was spotlessly clean both in the main room and bathroom.
en-unannotated-10660	Loved the decor and the bar lobby.
en-unannotated-10661	We were on the road side of the hotel and sitting out would have been noisy.
en-unannotated-10662	There is a yard, enough place for parking.
en-unannotated-10663	I have to endure the smell that emanates from Miel on a daily basis.
en-unannotated-10664	MUST TRY.
en-unannotated-10665	I'd say go for fun ambiance and endless beer!
en-unannotated-10666	Service is brilliant.
en-unannotated-10667	Excellent for hipsters who detest sterile shopping mallish places.
en-unannotated-10668	Make a reservation; place is tiny.
en-unannotated-10669	A mix of locals and tourists.
en-unannotated-10670	The location right on the beach was lovely as long as the weather was good!
en-unannotated-10671	and with a bottle of Corsican rose...
en-unannotated-10672	When you have to wait quite some time for the food, you know it's made with heart and soul.
en-unannotated-10673	The only problem I have with it from time to time.
en-unannotated-10674	Their signature sauce is a gift from the pasta gods to mankind.
en-unannotated-10675	It's a great place to try some traditional Colombian dishes.
en-unannotated-10676	Super cool and the best food.
en-unannotated-10677	Received professional and courteous service throughout my stay from front desk receptionist Isabel which also included tips for local places to eat that turned out to be awesome!
en-unannotated-10678	The location is just perfect as we walked from the train station as well to reach the place.
en-unannotated-10679	Very flavorful!
en-unannotated-10680	I went with my husband, on a Saturday night, the overall service was good.
en-unannotated-10681	It's not far from Notre Damn but far enough so you get a more intimate experience.
en-unannotated-10682	So I won't write the same thing over and over just this:
en-unannotated-10683	Nice setting off the main harbor strip.
en-unannotated-10684	this would encourage me to give 5 star.
en-unannotated-10685	We were lucky to snag a reservation on the way into Paris Saturday for the following Monday evening (note that dinner is a single seating) and get a table right next to the kitchen where we could see [NAME] work his magic.
en-unannotated-10686	We took some recommendations from Isabel (one of the sisters who own...
en-unannotated-10687	A lot of room in the apartment.
en-unannotated-10688	I had 54 keys and it disappeared from the game.
en-unannotated-10689	I had to upgrade to a room with courtyard view to avoid street noise!
en-unannotated-10690	It says Nintendo then the red screen goes blank.
en-unannotated-10691	Once you move from the lobby you notice that the place is very tired.
en-unannotated-10692	It was great that the host waited for us even though we arrived around midnight.
en-unannotated-10693	VERY ADDICTIVE.
en-unannotated-10694	Get there before 2p.
en-unannotated-10695	Otherwise every 30 minutes.
en-unannotated-10696	Loved this place practically from the moment we checked in.
en-unannotated-10697	Just ask the hostess for directions!
en-unannotated-10698	Wished we could have stayed a lot longer but am thrilled we have now found our permanent hotel base when in Rome which is quite often.
en-unannotated-10699	- Wouldn't deliver our coffees to our room, but wouldn't let us bring the cups on a *plastic* tray, in case "we'd steal it" (!?);
en-unannotated-10700	Otherwise, we would have given it a rating of five.
en-unannotated-10701	Can't remember the name but the third one from the menu.
en-unannotated-10702	Has gone completely downhill since it changed from Hailo.
en-unannotated-10703	[name] was a terrific host!
en-unannotated-10704	Owned by the same owner as Bunker Coffee, this coffee shop (and evening bar) is a must-visit in Brisbane.
en-unannotated-10705	The unquestionable hits were the brussel sprouts that came with the fish of the day (best ever, I'd say), corn on the cob with all that delicious whipped feta, the pork shoulder that could have (and in fact did) feed a small family, and the roast spatchcock.
en-unannotated-10706	Finding it needs nerve particuarly climbing hills.
en-unannotated-10707	I have to start off this review by saying....
en-unannotated-10708	I compare the W with previous stays at the JW Marriott, Four Seasons Bogota, Sofitel, Opera Hotel and many others over the last 30 years.
en-unannotated-10709	Lots of other eating places located nearby.
en-unannotated-10710	This restaurant belongs to a small chain in CZ.
en-unannotated-10711	We were treated like royalty by the General Manager, Juan Carlos Valencia.
en-unannotated-10712	Cheap and quality food near Parc de la Ciutadella.
en-unannotated-10713	However, worst fish and chips I have ever had....
en-unannotated-10714	Upon arrival we were greeted by [name].
en-unannotated-10715	Absolutely recommendable...
en-unannotated-10716	Definitely will be a destination on my next trip.
en-unannotated-10717	The Tapa Breton is absolutely delicious – lovely grilled cheese with all kinds...
en-unannotated-10718	We have been Hilton Diamond members for close to 10 years and I can say this is one of the worst hotels we've stayed in.
en-unannotated-10719	Also, very large and filling - especially for around $10 USD (drink and fries included!
en-unannotated-10720	Sat for another 15 minutes still no service.
en-unannotated-10721	Rooms on the higher floor are a little quieter.
en-unannotated-10722	Thank you for fixing this issue so freeking fast!!
en-unannotated-10723	Cafe de la Luz is a nice local coffee place in a lovely area of Madrid.
en-unannotated-10724	Will definitely come back soon.
en-unannotated-10725	And to my delight, kitchen clearly took pity on my sad non-burger and threw in some extra grilled zucchini, pineapple, and eggplant - WIN!
en-unannotated-10726	The food was delicious, but nothing earth shattering (I had the bangers and mash). Whether or not you decide to eat here, you should definitely at least have a pint at this landmark as it is so close to Guiness and a good midpoint on your way to Jameson.
en-unannotated-10727	I wouldn't have had it any other way to be honest.
en-unannotated-10728	The reservation process was flawless.
en-unannotated-10729	I was genuinely upset that I can't eat this every night.
en-unannotated-10730	This is our third stay at this hotel and since our first stay, we loved it.
en-unannotated-10731	and the drinks were perfcet.
en-unannotated-10732	They had a selection of flavored water that was almost juice and tasted really good.
en-unannotated-10733	The red wine of the house was the best local wine according to the guy who served us and it didn't disappointed us.
en-unannotated-10734	After checking out the sunset at Sacré-Cœur and taking a few pictures outside of Moulin Rouge, my wife and I were feeling hungry so we decided to check this place out based on the Yelp reviews.
en-unannotated-10735	- Breakfast was very poor with very little variety.
en-unannotated-10736	My partner had the tostadas and he loved them.
en-unannotated-10737	Regularly bringing in new brews on tap for your tasting pleasure and trying out new cocktail recipes the Brew team does it up right.
en-unannotated-10738	The bath, shower and toilet were either broken or not working properly.
en-unannotated-10739	I think that there were more than 25 courses, but who am I to complain.
en-unannotated-10740	He made suggestions based on what he thought the kitchen was performing best on that day.
en-unannotated-10741	Keep the updates coming Fortafy Games!!!!
en-unannotated-10742	This hotel is over priced for the accommodations provided.
en-unannotated-10743	I can't find one singel thing that they do wrong.
en-unannotated-10744	They welcomed us with a glass of Prosecco on the house and served very good bread with an interesting yoghurt butter.
en-unannotated-10745	Worst support and service in the human history.
en-unannotated-10746	Well worth a stay.
en-unannotated-10747	The brunch is excellent, the service is very good and the decoration is nice.
en-unannotated-10748	The Milanese risotto was delicious.
en-unannotated-10749	The waitstaff in the restaurant was very good....
en-unannotated-10750	This app would be the best music app if one problem could be fixed.
en-unannotated-10751	Very comfortable rooms with comfy beds and pillows.
en-unannotated-10752	Basically tasted like a super stuffed veggie quesadilla but it was delicious.
en-unannotated-10753	We came by here on New Year's Day for lunch, and chose two dry-aged steaks and a sausage to eat in.
en-unannotated-10754	Great atmosphere near the river and excellent service!
en-unannotated-10755	We had to wait one hour for the food in a friday evening.
en-unannotated-10756	The beer was good and SO CHEAP - $2 for a giant mug!!
en-unannotated-10757	Got the veal paired with a Languedoc wine and it was spectacular!
en-unannotated-10758	I had the 3-course selection and my husband ordered off the à la carte menu.
en-unannotated-10759	Excellent hotel I will recommended to my friends and family .
en-unannotated-10760	Will come again on my upcoming trip to Paris!
en-unannotated-10761	If you forget or it is a lot of hassle there is an ATM next to the cocktail bar ($2.50 charge for using said privilege)
en-unannotated-10762	The Portion sizes were perfect for lunch and sadly I had no room for dessert.
en-unannotated-10763	Probably one of the best veal Milanese I've had.
en-unannotated-10764	Buzzing ambiance adds to the experience.
en-unannotated-10765	So while the drinks and food are on the pricey side, everything was a party in my mouth!
en-unannotated-10766	Too crowded to get service without a battle, but if you want to meet people - this might be a plus.
en-unannotated-10767	All in all a great dinner very close to the heart of duomo.
en-unannotated-10768	All important place in Rome in walking distance.
en-unannotated-10769	Would highly recommend considering the cheap prices as well.
en-unannotated-10770	But I will never stay there again.
en-unannotated-10771	It was a really hot day.
en-unannotated-10772	I think for what we got it was value.
en-unannotated-10773	Once we arrived and say the beauty and class of this restaurant,...
en-unannotated-10774	We loved our stay here!
en-unannotated-10775	Taxi's are not expensive.
en-unannotated-10776	Prior to arrival I went back and forth with the conceirge 10+ emails to get reservations for dinner.
en-unannotated-10777	My guess is that the fish was battered and frozen in a factory...
en-unannotated-10778	This place is hidden off one of the side streets from the main square and was not packed with tourists.
en-unannotated-10779	I planned a visit to celebrate my husbands 50th birthday and wanted something different and exciting to mark the special day and was delighted that Uma delivered in every way.
en-unannotated-10780	Color switch is easily my favorite game!
en-unannotated-10781	Food was OK, a little fussy, but good atmosphere, service was excellent and BYOB with no corkage is the best.
en-unannotated-10782	Of course you can say that we have some more special places for coffee lovers in Moscow but if you are far from them and still want to get a great coffee and deserts - choose it!
en-unannotated-10783	My friend wanted spinach but was barred from ordering it with her fried cheese platter.
en-unannotated-10784	But overall great experience and service was friendly.
en-unannotated-10785	It feels like one long run on sentence, but that's because I'm constantly drooling about Nase Maso.
en-unannotated-10786	It has few rooms (just one or two floors). We did not book breakfast, but you can easily cross the river and sit in any of the bar restaurants and eat something there.
en-unannotated-10787	It is a shame
en-unannotated-10788	The woman was extremely rude.
en-unannotated-10789	The actual risotto was the creamiest, but also thickest, I've had and I loved that.
en-unannotated-10790	Several wine bottles are displayed on the walls which fits the dark decor.
en-unannotated-10791	Real home cooked feel and good choice on the menu.
en-unannotated-10792	My girlfriend said, "we should come back here for lunch tomorrow". Would highly recommend this place to my friends.
en-unannotated-10793	I can't remember what we order, but I'm sure you can't go wrong.
en-unannotated-10794	This place is cool, a bit hipstery, and has a kind of Greenwich village vibe.
en-unannotated-10795	The service at the hotel was excellent.
en-unannotated-10796	Service was friendly and fast.
en-unannotated-10797	My bun-less burger looked a little odd but props to Miel for making it look as good as it did!
en-unannotated-10798	Las Alcobas ticks all the boxes for me!!
en-unannotated-10799	Great service, everyone here is so friendly and the hot choccies are wonderful.
en-unannotated-10800	Tons of lovely restaurants very close.
en-unannotated-10801	After that I ordered spaghetti cacio e Pepe (salt and pepper). It was sublime and the sauce was so velvety it coated every tastebud on my tongue like silk on a geisha.
en-unannotated-10802	This hotel has very good service and location is great!
en-unannotated-10803	We went to Columbus for my sons soccer team at the Starburst Soccer tournament, the hotel were tremendous hosts to put up with a bunch of screaming soccer kids from 5-18 so I would recommend them over and over again
en-unannotated-10804	The soup was thick and very savory.
en-unannotated-10805	To start, we ordered the: serve of the Scallops each with apple & fennel (1 piece each $8) & Pork belly tacos, with bean paste, cabbage, & apple kimchi ($14 - 2 pieces). Both were absolutely superb!
en-unannotated-10806	EVERYTHING was delicious.
en-unannotated-10807	The owner obviously takes pride in his establishment.
en-unannotated-10808	The best fries ever!
en-unannotated-10809	Bright, modern apartment in a fabulous central location, close to all the attractions, local eateries and artisan's shops.
en-unannotated-10810	People have ummed and ah'ed about whether or not this is 3* Michelin dining.
en-unannotated-10811	When we arrived we were initially shocked by the smell which is not pleasant and rather overwhelming.
en-unannotated-10812	Force stop forever.
en-unannotated-10813	I love the electronic swing music 😀! Definitly going back next time
en-unannotated-10814	It's small, be sure to get reservations and you'll enjoy a great night.
en-unannotated-10815	she said the same its fully booked.
en-unannotated-10816	One of my favorite desserts in all our time in France.
en-unannotated-10817	NH collection colon is a true jem; modern and kept very clean; breakfast delights with exceptional variety; location is perfect-walking distance from most of Madrid's landmarks.
en-unannotated-10818	The atmosphere is calm, staff nice and polite.
en-unannotated-10819	Deleted until you fix this.
en-unannotated-10820	We had such a great dining experience here.
en-unannotated-10821	We called last minute and scored a late seating.
en-unannotated-10822	The chicken burger was just amazing!
en-unannotated-10823	It was so good that I decided to change my name to goulash.
en-unannotated-10824	It was awesome.
en-unannotated-10825	Expensive breakfast
en-unannotated-10826	If you are a fan of the boxty, you can even buy a box of the mix to take home!
en-unannotated-10827	While there is some merit to that, there is nothing like a great meal, and Mlejnice did not disappoint at all.
en-unannotated-10828	A beutiful veal chop and risotto with the best osobuco.
en-unannotated-10829	Great food and great service.
en-unannotated-10830	This game is a great time killer as is and very fun.
en-unannotated-10831	Needless to say, this restaurant didn't disappoint.
en-unannotated-10832	Their menu is simple as good restaurants should be.
en-unannotated-10833	It's not quiet here being in the heart of Temple Bar and I found the service a bit slow.
en-unannotated-10834	The food and the service was exceptional.
en-unannotated-10835	Value for money is poor!!!
en-unannotated-10836	Check in was at 3pm and our room was still not ready by 4.20pm!
en-unannotated-10837	We stayed 4 nights in Mexico City and returning back to this hotel was very relaxing.
en-unannotated-10838	Definitely stop by here.
en-unannotated-10839	Choose from milk, dark or white hot chocolate, and add your flavour.
en-unannotated-10840	You can tell they love what they do and that is translated and passed to the food.
en-unannotated-10841	I had a bacon and egg bagel, it had double everything and was very tasty.
en-unannotated-10842	Friends also liked their fish pie with mashed potato crust and just the right amount of dill.
en-unannotated-10843	We stopped here for the night travelling back from Valencia.
en-unannotated-10844	Really good, fresh food and reasonable prices.
en-unannotated-10845	Beautiful building and furnishings.
en-unannotated-10846	This is a small and well designed hotel, great for a one nighter.
en-unannotated-10847	If you are looking for ambiance this is not the place to go.
en-unannotated-10848	Wow.
en-unannotated-10849	Very nice staff and delicious breakfast.
en-unannotated-10850	Service was very good and though we were downstairs where it was pretty quiet we did not lack for anything....
en-unannotated-10851	This place is located in the old town area, a very touristy area, where lots of overpriced restaurants are.
en-unannotated-10852	Staff was very friendly and helpful.
en-unannotated-10853	The first was underwhelming (Cyril's) and we were hoping to believe the reports we heard about Lokal.
en-unannotated-10854	I started with the tomato basil soup and freshly made bread.
en-unannotated-10855	The meals were also very hearty and generous in serving, there was no skimping on the amount of broth or meat served, nor in the vegetables, which I find is common in fine dining.
en-unannotated-10856	I recommend!
en-unannotated-10857	A beautiful, classic hotel.
en-unannotated-10858	The piano player was also a plus!
en-unannotated-10859	That's true.
en-unannotated-10860	I should be able to listen to my playlists without shuffle play.
en-unannotated-10861	The service is perfect and the food is delicious.
en-unannotated-10862	The staff there were really friendly.
en-unannotated-10863	Bread is freshly baked, and it makes a difference.
en-unannotated-10864	Great portions - 10€ for Sandwich and 4€ for side of fries.
en-unannotated-10865	Had a room facing the plaza, with a slice of ocean view.
en-unannotated-10866	Brand new, clean, very modern, and close to the airport.
en-unannotated-10867	He then bought us a round of drinks.
en-unannotated-10868	This place is great for watching sports together or just hanging out with friends while drinking some beer.
en-unannotated-10869	Everyone should definitely come here !
en-unannotated-10870	nice breakfast, calm bedroom and the terrace is small but nice
en-unannotated-10871	It's in a little alleyway with just a chalkboard sign and very easy to miss.
en-unannotated-10872	The extensive free breakfast has a variety of options, and every evening, a "manager's happy hour" offers snacks and free drinks to hotel customers.
en-unannotated-10873	Large room and very nice breakfast, I recommend
en-unannotated-10874	Plus points for the nice waitresses and the cosy atmosphere.
en-unannotated-10875	The cheeseburger was definitely the best part!
en-unannotated-10876	Last but not least, the desserts!
en-unannotated-10877	My first time in such a dinner - not my...
en-unannotated-10878	Great restaurant!
en-unannotated-10879	All 4 of the dishes were excellent.
en-unannotated-10880	The room!
en-unannotated-10881	Food: Fresh, simple and tasty.
en-unannotated-10882	You can't stop drinking on just one cup.
en-unannotated-10883	Looking for the best coffee in Brisbane's CBD?
en-unannotated-10884	Wonderful french restaurant tucked away on a quiet street in Paris away from crowds and tourists in the Le Marais section of the city.
en-unannotated-10885	This tiny restaurant has meatless Spanish style empanadas, pizza, and many other delicious vegetarian options - really good news in porkcentric Spain.
en-unannotated-10886	Will return!
en-unannotated-10887	We choice the prix fix for $36 euro which was an appetizer and main.
en-unannotated-10888	A very convenient experience overall.
en-unannotated-10889	All in all a very yummy experience.
en-unannotated-10890	However, I had to wait 45 minutes to be seated, and the bartender seeing my polite patience rewarded me with the first available table on my turn which was a four top which I gestured shouldn't be wasted on me, but he insisted, so I sat with little more resistance.
en-unannotated-10891	The chocolate was smooth and very delicious.
en-unannotated-10892	The egg cocotte was so good.
en-unannotated-10893	As it stands you can play all day and the game keeps kicking out more snakes.
en-unannotated-10894	Went here for a drink.
en-unannotated-10895	Really like the experience!
en-unannotated-10896	I went there with my girlfriend, she felt stomach sick so didn't want to order however I was starving and looking forward to try those popular mussels .
en-unannotated-10897	It is a REAL restaurant in a tourist infested and infected town.
en-unannotated-10898	And breakfast was also provided.
en-unannotated-10899	Good value for the money and gave me a good experience on how it is like eating like a local in Milan.
en-unannotated-10900	We were standing with our drinks then a high table was free, although reserved for people at 7, they said we could take a pew until the people turned up.
en-unannotated-10901	Amazing sauce.
en-unannotated-10902	You won't regret it.
en-unannotated-10903	Consists of a laneway of tables, a main dining area, a front bar/low seated area and a massive outdoor table.
en-unannotated-10904	He checked back on us frequently and made sure our glasses were never empty.
en-unannotated-10905	Location was good but everything else was so expensive!
en-unannotated-10906	If we stayed in Paris longer we would've came back.
en-unannotated-10907	I really enjoyed the diverse selection of quality Japanese inspired cocktails available too.
en-unannotated-10908	They show a lot of professionalism and at the same time very careful with the details.
en-unannotated-10909	Bouillabaisse was nothing special.
en-unannotated-10910	They just started having cider on tap so we tasted the Westons Stowford Press!
en-unannotated-10911	It was sooo cheesy and so flavorful.
en-unannotated-10912	At the desk there were several ohers also complaning and then had to pay extra money to get a substational room.
en-unannotated-10913	It was snowing a lot outside and we were seated by the Windows.
en-unannotated-10914	I stayed at this hotel for 5 days over the Memorial Day weekend.
en-unannotated-10915	The Empanadas were fantastic.
en-unannotated-10916	Perfect, just perfect.
en-unannotated-10917	By far, my favorite dish on the whole trip.
en-unannotated-10918	This is really as good as it gets.
en-unannotated-10919	This new Facebook authentication f*cking sucks, sort it out tinder!!!!
en-unannotated-10920	Would recommend everyone who visits this lovely city!
en-unannotated-10921	The staff would arrange drivers, it was near the US embassy and many restaurants were close by.
en-unannotated-10922	Location was really good and breakfast was good too.
en-unannotated-10923	If your trip overlaps a change in the weekly specials, go back and check it out.
en-unannotated-10924	It can be a little hit or miss depending on the variation of the tasting menu they have at the moment, but the range is from...
en-unannotated-10925	You will feel right at home and instantly know that there is no other more wonderful decision you could have made then spending an evening savoring her delightful vegan menu, amazing warmth, and beautiful...
en-unannotated-10926	Excellent customer service from all the people who attended to us especially from the woman with the white coat on - great personality!
en-unannotated-10927	OMGAHHH!
en-unannotated-10928	there is no other polite way to start this review!
en-unannotated-10929	This was our second meal in Prague.
en-unannotated-10930	By the time we returned to our room for the one night's stay, it was too late to switch rooms.
en-unannotated-10931	It was good and served with carrots and bread.
en-unannotated-10932	As my casually dressed friends ordered cocktails, I ordered a classy ..
en-unannotated-10933	Wasn't really a fan of the bread, it was very tough, hard to bite into.
en-unannotated-10934	We could hear next door guest's even snoring so it was a bit of problem.
en-unannotated-10935	The public areas, especially the elevators were disgustingly filthy.
en-unannotated-10936	It is a very fine restaurant.
en-unannotated-10937	Food was OK.
en-unannotated-10938	We booked this hotel because of the excellent reviews and the fact that there was on site parking.
en-unannotated-10939	The location is close to the Duomo and the wait staff was friendly and helpful.
en-unannotated-10940	Also the price is overhyped by the tourists.
en-unannotated-10941	The airport transfers arranged for us by the management did not show.
en-unannotated-10942	The location is very good, close to Metro stations,shopping, restaurants and a short walk to the center.
en-unannotated-10943	Walls are scratched, paint chipped, not clean.
en-unannotated-10944	Even the 2 devout meat eaters left full &...
en-unannotated-10945	Can recommend when in Madrid.
en-unannotated-10946	The room is big and comfortable.
en-unannotated-10947	The place is not very large, I can see why others that do not have a reservation would have a hard time finding seats on busier days.
en-unannotated-10948	Its a three...
en-unannotated-10949	This hotel had location as its biggest plus.
en-unannotated-10950	I've visited Mexico City before, but this was my 1st time staying at this particular hotel.
en-unannotated-10951	My new favourite place for a fine dining or have a decent dinner River view, all glass windows, good service, fabulous bar.
en-unannotated-10952	In both occasions the bathroom had a strong unpleasant odor: humidity and old walls in the shower.
en-unannotated-10953	The ceilings were beautifully intricate.
en-unannotated-10954	This place is just the sort of place I love to write about most.
en-unannotated-10955	Good service too.
en-unannotated-10956	Awesome cafe by day | Cool little bar by night
en-unannotated-10957	Please FIX i can't add any more songs to my playlist.
en-unannotated-10958	We went to CDMX for the Formula 1 race and while I was there, a great friend suggested this restaurant to us.
en-unannotated-10959	Great coffee and best jam croissant.
en-unannotated-10960	It was very very good.
en-unannotated-10961	Enjoy the beautiful rooms, the small tables, and the presentation.
en-unannotated-10962	There are other strange decorations around the bar that are, I suppose, to give it a hipstery feel.
en-unannotated-10963	We were tired, so we did not want to go very far away.
en-unannotated-10964	He hesitated at first and by the end of the meal agreed it was a good bargain.
en-unannotated-10965	I would recommend everyone to try...
en-unannotated-10966	Ny and my girlfriend both ordered the 180g Acco Wagyu Rump Cap, with a side of steamed vegetables and French Fries.
en-unannotated-10967	I ate it to the very last spoonful.
en-unannotated-10968	Went to come here the night before but couldn't get a table so made reservations for the next night.
en-unannotated-10969	Sip on your complimentary small glass of prosecco and enjoy the food.
en-unannotated-10970	best salad in corsica.
en-unannotated-10971	A talented Chef , great host , funny personality, perfection seeker , fusion between French and Asian cuisines , respect to special requests , totally worth it.
en-unannotated-10972	A+
en-unannotated-10973	No comparison: overall quality is far above others and prices are similar!
en-unannotated-10974	No apology was offered for our experience.
en-unannotated-10975	Would highly recommend.
en-unannotated-10976	We just happened to stumble across this place and wanted to find out why it was so popular - ordered the red velvet and pineapple & coconut cake .
en-unannotated-10977	Deceptively a lot of tables but frequently booked out for dinner Fri/Sat and lunches later on in the week.
en-unannotated-10978	Lovely hotel...
en-unannotated-10979	I cannot say enough how lovely the hotel is....
en-unannotated-10980	This is place is a every time absolutely must to do.
en-unannotated-10981	Now I'm going to share an opinion that will potentially offend some Guinness lovers, but I think that this is the best stout in Ireland!
en-unannotated-10982	Even though what's on display is not always my thing supporting the local talent always gets a thumbs up.
en-unannotated-10983	The WC is clean and neat too :)
en-unannotated-10984	The cutest place in Milan.
en-unannotated-10985	The soup was made perfect by two slices of grilled soda bread and a very generous slab of butter.
en-unannotated-10986	They cancelled the games Fri evening and Sat morning due to bad weather.
en-unannotated-10987	They don't have things like this in the States.
en-unannotated-10988	Very good in general but could do with a section for ads that accept swaps so people dont bother you when you dont accept trades.
en-unannotated-10989	air conditioning and the bedroom style is a bit old
en-unannotated-10990	we had a chuckle and enjoyed some...
en-unannotated-10991	The desk staff are really helpful, advising on bus timetables, journey time to airport etc.
en-unannotated-10992	2. Seasonal/Weekly Menu Changes and Availability.
en-unannotated-10993	The soft tacos was delicious as the pairing of pork belly and the sweet apple kimchi balanced out perfectly.
en-unannotated-10994	A truly amazing dining experience.
en-unannotated-10995	There are only a few tables so it is a good idea...
en-unannotated-10996	If you're in the Temple Bar area of Dublin, pop by and you'll be pleased.
en-unannotated-10997	I tried to book le Cinq but it was already fully booked 2 months advance.
en-unannotated-10998	Only downside is they don't really have tables, and space is limited, otherwise, A+ on the coffee, service, and ambience!
en-unannotated-10999	The onion flavor was a bit weak but the cheese on top was good.
en-unannotated-11000	Loved the Aqua di Parma toiletries!
en-unannotated-11001	Staff makes you feel you are dealing with the owner or better.
en-unannotated-11002	Good food, nice persons, what else ?
en-unannotated-11003	Nice staff, good quality breakfast but it's necessary to improve the variety.
en-unannotated-11004	Just a side note we came back next day and the menu was lunch.
en-unannotated-11005	We love cider so naturally Verve has been a local favourite for us for quite some time.
en-unannotated-11006	:)
en-unannotated-11007	The mashed potatoes was outstanding.
en-unannotated-11008	The service is excellent, you can tell these guys have been there forever.
en-unannotated-11009	In fact, the only thing really visible - I had to gently push the cheese to one side in order to take a photo.
en-unannotated-11010	Great spot in the Latin Quarter, my wife and I have had almost everything on the menu.
en-unannotated-11011	Awful app-takes  Impossible to get a driver most of time.
en-unannotated-11012	Didn't think it was worth it but a lot of reviewers had different opinions.
en-unannotated-11013	I was on a business and ate alone, and the waiter made me feel very comfortable in this adorably cute little restaurant, which has been family owned for a long time (I forget how long, but long).
en-unannotated-11014	I went to many other top rated restaurants in Paris, but this is the top one.
en-unannotated-11015	It had a rich melt-y center that reminded me of a lava cake.
en-unannotated-11016	Quality and choice of meat are outstanding.
en-unannotated-11017	Which was basically like beef stew over super creamy grits BEST polenta I've ever had.
en-unannotated-11018	Casa medina was always one of the top adresses in Bogota.
en-unannotated-11019	The lamb and the flavored sliced potatoes was SO delicious!!
en-unannotated-11020	They have a varying dish of the day for around 16.000 pesos which includes a juice, soup, main dish, and a small dessert.
en-unannotated-11021	Nice restaurant 10 kilometers from Ajaccio.
en-unannotated-11022	To be honest, I didn't like mole at all, so I avoided everything with mole for the rest of my vacation in Mexico.
en-unannotated-11023	It's very small, with maybe about 8 or 9 little tables.
en-unannotated-11024	Not too shabby!
en-unannotated-11025	First to start, an organic cheese plate, all local cheeses with some fruit jams to accompany it.
en-unannotated-11026	But they may need to keep raising the prices to control the crowd?
en-unannotated-11027	It is a very small, intimate place, the service was very good, and the food for the most part was excellent.
en-unannotated-11028	My wife thought this was excellent.
en-unannotated-11029	We were in Prague 7 days and ate here three times!
en-unannotated-11030	Good food.
en-unannotated-11031	So for those who don't speak Italian, you're in luck.
en-unannotated-11032	We had taco camaron...
en-unannotated-11033	Check out procedure was a little slow.
en-unannotated-11034	This is the best place we have eaten at in all of Paris.
en-unannotated-11035	Came here to see the review and thousand of people having the same issue.
en-unannotated-11036	One of our friends got the menu with escargot instead to try and that was delicious as well- more garlic and pesto than whatever snail tastes like lol (you'll be okay if you try it). Our main entree was duck confit and wao I am so impressed with how all the flavors worked together.
en-unannotated-11037	Even had a Japanese whiskey to start- never heard of it but it was excellent and the bottle of red wine from the south of France was delicious.
en-unannotated-11038	That aside, it's great to be served by nice people, but I came here to eat, so let's devour that.
en-unannotated-11039	Had no problem with the language barrier.
en-unannotated-11040	Overall, it was enjoyable meal and the meat was full of flavor.
en-unannotated-11041	We were very excited to have this experience based on the reviews prior.
en-unannotated-11042	The Hidden Factory is very hard to find, even when you try to follow the instructions from the mail.
en-unannotated-11043	This place is allergy friendly!
en-unannotated-11044	Because some people are being billed for looking like a noob but there parents won't allow them to buy rubux.
en-unannotated-11045	The Cafe au Late is killer.
en-unannotated-11046	Great little place that serves fantastic chicken sandwiches.
en-unannotated-11047	I went to this restaurant many times and always the beef is very good , also the octopus starter is very good I recommend to visit with reservation in advance
en-unannotated-11048	treatment grate and good food.
en-unannotated-11049	It is very small and out of the central tourist area.
en-unannotated-11050	so whether you are in the area you should visit taberna dakara bi
en-unannotated-11051	I'd recommend the more standard bar fare, such as the burger.
en-unannotated-11052	Delightful desserts: Moelleux au chocolat and Brioche Perdue et Chantilly.
en-unannotated-11053	The rooms and the beds are comfortable, the bathroom is good and there is a small balcony.
en-unannotated-11054	Truly delectable meal.
en-unannotated-11055	Highly recommended!
en-unannotated-11056	We did the 5 course tasting menu with wine pairing and were not disappointed.
en-unannotated-11057	Certainly not a 5 star standard but hopefully Starwood invest some money back into this place and restore it to its previous glory.
en-unannotated-11058	Can't beat the location!
en-unannotated-11059	Irish stew was fantastic.
en-unannotated-11060	It is a nice dining experience with some interesting options beyond a baguette.
en-unannotated-11061	They charged me two euros for a glass of seltzer!
en-unannotated-11062	I can uncomfortably say thr meal i had here is close to if not the best meal i have ever had.
en-unannotated-11063	The floor is loose a bit.
en-unannotated-11064	Great restaurant!
en-unannotated-11065	I enjoyed that we had a "call button" on our table so that we could get service whenever we needed it.
en-unannotated-11066	Simone was very helpful and polite.
en-unannotated-11067	The baby spinach served with the cheese had clearly not been washed properly - grainy and dirty.
en-unannotated-11068	While some of you may think that Beef Tartare leans more towards the French cuisine realm, it apparently is popular Czech food as well.
en-unannotated-11069	I understand that people need a way to earn money, but that's what the ads are for.
en-unannotated-11070	The menu includes a range of cold and hot starters and main meals plus a grill section for steaks and large shared meat plates.
en-unannotated-11071	I'm pretty sure my dining companion loved the food.
en-unannotated-11072	Absolutely one of the best stops we made on our very short trip to Prague.
en-unannotated-11073	We are not meatloaf lovers in general, so we would suggest that you give it a try if you are.
en-unannotated-11074	Our first evening in Paris we were tired, needed some dinner, but wanted something light.
en-unannotated-11075	He chose one appetizer of octopus and another of Spider Crab.
en-unannotated-11076	Don't know how nobody has pointed that out.
en-unannotated-11077	the food was amazing, we couldn't get enough!
en-unannotated-11078	It's cooked perfectly...
en-unannotated-11079	[name] did our check-in where she provided us with all the information we needed to know.
en-unannotated-11080	My steak was PERFECT.
en-unannotated-11081	This Angelina has a tea room and a boutique.
en-unannotated-11082	Brew is my favourite happening place at the moment.
en-unannotated-11083	Great app and awesome customer service if you ever have an issue (very rarely). They had a slew if bugs about a year ago, but not even a single issue since then.
en-unannotated-11084	The hotel was very modern and upscale in look with great service from all we encountered there.
en-unannotated-11085	The Great Laneways of Brisbane!
en-unannotated-11086	Wow!
en-unannotated-11087	We only wanted to spend one night here and had read reviews about the small rooms.
en-unannotated-11088	If a restaurant can make you feel like you're at home even if you're thousands of miles away from it then they're probably doing something right.
en-unannotated-11089	From the moment that you walk into to this small restaurant you know you are in for a treat.
en-unannotated-11090	That one might be a miss.
en-unannotated-11091	The concierge was very helpful with suggestions and maps.
en-unannotated-11092	The coffee shop is in a supermarket ticked away in a corner.
en-unannotated-11093	The perfect spot for a special dinner, great food and original recipes, especially fish as one would expect given the location.
en-unannotated-11094	The tasting menu is well paced for about a 2 to 2.5 hour meal.
en-unannotated-11095	Portion sizes are huge and the wines are great.
en-unannotated-11096	Oh, and the soundtrack to the evening was right on the money for the vibe - Sigur Ros followed by the National.
en-unannotated-11097	The pheasant tortellini entree had it going on!
en-unannotated-11098	We were pleasantly surprised.
en-unannotated-11099	Be crazy!
en-unannotated-11100	We got the tuna carpaccio started and steak for mains and it was quite possibly the best steak I've ever had.
en-unannotated-11101	Two dinners in five days here...
en-unannotated-11102	There is a good range of drinks, and even the bread is delicious.
en-unannotated-11103	The food however was poorly flavored, all you could really taste was a lot of pepper.
en-unannotated-11104	Slightly difficult to find but any of the local workers will direct you without hesitation.
en-unannotated-11105	Despite all the running around that the waiter was doing he managed to take our order and make recommendations without barely breaking a sweat.
en-unannotated-11106	But you are greeted by the friendliest people in all of Paris and that's when the magic begins.
en-unannotated-11107	They know everything about meat!
en-unannotated-11108	We stayed for 5 nights at this quiet, restful hotel which is located right across the street from beautiful Retiro Park (and only a fee blocks from the Prado). Be sure to stay in one of the balconied rooms overlooking this lush oasis.
en-unannotated-11109	But wow wow wow.
en-unannotated-11110	The concierge was very helpful with some tips of the city.
en-unannotated-11111	I've never had to wait too long for a coffee to-go.
en-unannotated-11112	Recommend the Salt and Pepper Squid and Octopus to start.
en-unannotated-11113	(You can also order alla carte) This is amazingly inexpensive for cuisine of this quality and the excellent presentation.
en-unannotated-11114	The staff weren't cooperative & rude.
en-unannotated-11115	We gave him some parameters around cost and tastes and he was very good at sourcing the correct amounts and flavours!!
en-unannotated-11116	But in TripAdvisor it is overrated.
en-unannotated-11117	Service was also very friendly.
en-unannotated-11118	Service was impeccable (once they understood we were three people for 13:00h, and not 13 people for 3PM.
en-unannotated-11119	A little better I have some pictures now when I get into the ads, the advertisements down the bottom, no problems there, can't wait for the right update and a 5* rating again..
en-unannotated-11120	No iron ,no complemtery water in the room
en-unannotated-11121	Arriving shortly after 6:30pm, the people I was meeting mentioned there'd already been a flurry of people but from here on in it really started to dwindle and it was as if we were in our own private bar.
en-unannotated-11122	The Food was high quality , the service was extremely good!
en-unannotated-11123	Well colour me impressed.
en-unannotated-11124	So I'm not a big fan of it.
en-unannotated-11125	My husband and I still talk about how delicious it was!
en-unannotated-11126	Read about this place on tripadvisor
en-unannotated-11127	Their apartment was nicely decorated and all the food was so delicious and perfectly done that the experience overwhelmed all of ours expectations.
en-unannotated-11128	So I rephrased it into "ice cubes?"
en-unannotated-11129	well maintained, comfortable beds.
en-unannotated-11130	Can't cast to the tv.
en-unannotated-11131	The staff was so friendly and helpful.
en-unannotated-11132	I thought it tasted like a standard schnitzel plate.
en-unannotated-11133	Although I had a solid meal here, my expectations were a bit too high because of all the excellent reviews on here.
en-unannotated-11134	We wanted to try some authentic food.
en-unannotated-11135	It is a great joy to be greeted with such heartfelt warmth by Isabel and Pilar as our favorite table awaits us.
en-unannotated-11136	Breakfasts are great with a wide variety of meats, cheeses, breads, pastries.
en-unannotated-11137	Someone else at the table ordered it with their fish so she could have some.
en-unannotated-11138	Wow.
en-unannotated-11139	The staff was excellent - respectful and friendly.
en-unannotated-11140	Thisis over the road and was so good we went twice.
en-unannotated-11141	Lovely surprise pop-in.
en-unannotated-11142	The entire interior, including the red carpet, water fountain, and upholstery need to go.
en-unannotated-11143	I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough if you are looking for great value, perfect location, and most helpful staff you could ask for..
en-unannotated-11144	I suggest making reservations to avoid lines and be open to sitting in a communal table with other guests and tourists!
en-unannotated-11145	indulge me.
en-unannotated-11146	But i understand that this is a time pass game and can be plyed for removing boredom.
en-unannotated-11147	This place is amazing.
en-unannotated-11148	What can I add to the many wonderful reviews this restaurant has already received.
en-unannotated-11149	5/5, no question.
en-unannotated-11150	Onion Soup (€9.50)
en-unannotated-11151	Water pressure
en-unannotated-11152	The prices were very reasonable and food was just terrific.
en-unannotated-11153	This is a shame as they are good at what they do but my advice it to eat elsewhere and get better value for money.
en-unannotated-11154	- Decor is authentic and luxurious.
en-unannotated-11155	Excellent meal and relaxed, attentive service.
en-unannotated-11156	every plate that appeared was a work of art and exceptional in taste.
en-unannotated-11157	Everything about this restaurants meal was perfect and service was also wonderful.
en-unannotated-11158	Like 5 stars delicious.
en-unannotated-11159	Not much to complain.
en-unannotated-11160	Staff very helpful.
en-unannotated-11161	very small and old rooms , poorly furnished and decorated.
en-unannotated-11162	I had this superb egg dish to start.
en-unannotated-11163	Entrees of chicken oyster skewers, edamame beans, the 'pickled things' (eat the garlic - it tastes nothing like a clove of garlic but rather a delicate sweet bite), the three little pigs tortillas - all a wonderful introduction to your mains.
en-unannotated-11164	I left small gratuity and room was perfect when we returned.
en-unannotated-11165	The beef cheeks were so tender it literally melted.
en-unannotated-11166	Les escargots de Bourgogne | Escargots
en-unannotated-11167	As for the food, we never got to try.
en-unannotated-11168	Celebrity delighted to be greeted.
en-unannotated-11169	The Hotel stuff is very nice, breakfast has a good selection of food.
en-unannotated-11170	What went wrong exactly?
en-unannotated-11171	This has been a pleasant surprise in Bonifacio.
en-unannotated-11172	Definitely not a tourist spot and may very well be the best locals restaurant.
en-unannotated-11173	I will definitely stay here every time I come back to Bogotá. 100% recommended.
en-unannotated-11174	Hell, dunk your burger in it, its that good!
en-unannotated-11175	As you enter the metal gates, which reveals a narrow dimly - lit dining hall, we were led into another area just past the sleek lounge & bar area (to the other side of the restaurant), in front of the open kitchen.
en-unannotated-11176	I can't believe that I haven't tried out this restaurant and so glad I did.
en-unannotated-11177	Wandering through Madrid this afternoon having just been to the forgettable street markets .
en-unannotated-11178	OMG.
en-unannotated-11179	We were immediately surrounded by staff giving us more drinks and one of the wait staff' mother's homemade liquor to sample.
en-unannotated-11180	The potatoes have bacon and chives and they were perfect.
en-unannotated-11181	BUT.....
en-unannotated-11182	Breakfast with good variety from japanese to western with freshly squeeze juices and serve a good cup of coffee.
en-unannotated-11183	A little noisy through the night, but to be expected with the hotel being so central.
en-unannotated-11184	It runs and jumps over enemies for you and all you do is tap the screen to jump (even though it already jumps for you). Its too easy and easy mode isnt even turned on.
en-unannotated-11185	However, the meal was spectacular.
en-unannotated-11186	From doorman to bellman to front desk to maids and restaurant staff the quality was first rate in terms of helpfulness.
en-unannotated-11187	A gluten free bakery in the centre of madrid.
en-unannotated-11188	Outstanding service.
en-unannotated-11189	Great little spot for dinner if you are in the Montmartre area.
en-unannotated-11190	Keeps crashing 4 ads in
en-unannotated-11191	The presentation was nice but that's about it.
en-unannotated-11192	You get tomatoes and homemade meatballs as appetitive, a glass prosecco, limoncello and all lot of sweets for 3€ cupperto.
en-unannotated-11193	Everything was Great
en-unannotated-11194	Have to say that we found none of the courses had the 'wow' factor and some of them were just odd and not in a good way.
en-unannotated-11195	Excellent service and, omg, I'm looking forward to coming back for that tuna tartare!
en-unannotated-11196	But you can't see if stuff you want to buy is sold, waiting payment etc...
en-unannotated-11197	Although I'm sure everything here taste amazing, because I am a creature of habit, I always tend to order the same thing: the egg concotte foie gras to start, followed by the duck breast, and a delicious creme brûlée to end the night.
en-unannotated-11198	The k-nee comes on its own serving platter, with its own serving utensils instead of a regular fork and k-nife.
en-unannotated-11199	Just know that the bar area can get kind of smoky with all of the smokers in the event you decide to wait for a table there.
en-unannotated-11200	The chef makes all your food within 10 feet of you, in view.
en-unannotated-11201	We started with onion soup and onion rings with garlic sauce.
en-unannotated-11202	Service is great!
en-unannotated-11203	I want to first note that the first half of the restaurant is the smoking section, while the back half is non-smoking.
en-unannotated-11204	Use their service!!
en-unannotated-11205	We went back the next night with another friend.
en-unannotated-11206	This is consistently a great place, with a very helpful staff.
en-unannotated-11207	Stayed at the hotel with a colleague for 6 nights and though the location was perfect for us.
en-unannotated-11208	Can not wait to go back there
en-unannotated-11209	The room we had was astrocious!
en-unannotated-11210	As we had early tours we bought some apples for breakfast but when we returned back after the first day, one apple had mysteriously disappeared.
en-unannotated-11211	I think I´ve never had better pizza than this one.
en-unannotated-11212	Enjoy!
en-unannotated-11213	The table shared deserts and they were delicious.
en-unannotated-11214	Good hotel, close to main points.
en-unannotated-11215	Nice rooms, we had a view of the small plaza.
en-unannotated-11216	Great Brain Exercise This is now my favorite puzzle game!
en-unannotated-11217	You can also make reservations if you know what time you are going to be at Den Noc which is recommended.
en-unannotated-11218	We enjoyed the unusual environment..
en-unannotated-11219	If you want to be surrounded by french speakers, choose lunch!
en-unannotated-11220	There's an awesome tapas restaurant next door (forgot the name) but it's wonderful to check out.
en-unannotated-11221	The pork schnitzel was also good and more to our liking compared with the schnitzels we had until then through our trip of Europe.
en-unannotated-11222	Perfectly cooked as well.
en-unannotated-11223	I was immediately greeted with a warm welcome and escorted to my table.
en-unannotated-11224	I love this place!
en-unannotated-11225	The empanadas are fabulous and they also have amazing breakfast and lunch options.
en-unannotated-11226	The location is great too as you're walking distance from loads of attractions and shops.
en-unannotated-11227	So annoying!!!
en-unannotated-11228	Very packed on a Sunday afternoon, but we still found a table for 2. Service was prompt when flagged down.
en-unannotated-11229	Got the Pilsner urquell creme (0.5l). Beer here is so cheap!
en-unannotated-11230	Bed was rather firm but after a long flight from Australia was surprisingly good for our backs!
en-unannotated-11231	In room to make your coffe.
en-unannotated-11232	This is a fun and awesome game.
en-unannotated-11233	Great dining experience, would love...
en-unannotated-11234	Room tired and most things broken.
en-unannotated-11235	😞
en-unannotated-11236	And the staff was lovely, spoke English, knew exactly...
en-unannotated-11237	and the place is cozy and modern
en-unannotated-11238	What can I say the reviews are true.
en-unannotated-11239	Order the menu and get surprised.
en-unannotated-11240	DO NOT MISS this great find in Prague!!..
en-unannotated-11241	There's probably more but we wanted the same thing so you'll just have to try and see for yourself.
en-unannotated-11242	El servicio es excelente y la comida deliciosa en especial las entradas.
en-unannotated-11243	We stayed in this hotel for two nights in mid May.
en-unannotated-11244	The apartment was a fantastic size for our family of 4. Would definitely recommend!
en-unannotated-11245	2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a living room and a full kitchen.....
en-unannotated-11246	Fun restaurant, great food and great place to just hang and drink beers.
en-unannotated-11247	like how is it even possible?
en-unannotated-11248	Leans towards wine.
en-unannotated-11249	I really liked the classic beef pho bowl with bean sprouts and slices of beef.
en-unannotated-11250	to the food!
en-unannotated-11251	The chicken soup and the pork belly were the hits.
en-unannotated-11252	I would definitely recommend giving The Boxty House a try if you're not looking to eat at The Temple Bar.
en-unannotated-11253	There was no pushiness about it.
en-unannotated-11254	Simple menu of toast, eggs and others is the perfect breakfast accompaniment.
en-unannotated-11255	Tucked away in a laneway off a carpark (I said it was hipster!), is this little coffee shop gem.
en-unannotated-11256	While soundcloud is a decent service, the app is terribly made.
en-unannotated-11257	The hotel is just perfect for the price but it is out of major Bogota must do things.
en-unannotated-11258	My burger was a double pattie with double cheese (tasty & cheddar) gherkins, Spanish onion & aioli.
en-unannotated-11259	We were visiting some family in Milano and asked for a place to have a good milanesa (I know, I was going for silly). But they recommended this place which also coincided with our other friend's recommendation.
en-unannotated-11260	The food was absolutly top!
en-unannotated-11261	Service, Room, security, restaurants in the same place so you don't have to go out after a long day of work to look for something else.
en-unannotated-11262	Pancakes were good though I wasn't crazy about the flavor I got, which was mascarpone and lime.
en-unannotated-11263	From the outside this place looks just like meh.
en-unannotated-11264	Make sure to spread the butter on top of the bread and enjoy with the meats.
en-unannotated-11265	Love Verve!
en-unannotated-11266	In the restaurant they presented the bill to be signed ( as everywhere..) but after one hour or less the waiter was punching my door requesting the payment ( this happened three times..
en-unannotated-11267	A friend suggested I visit this restaurant to get an experience of the true Mexican food.
en-unannotated-11268	Stayed here for three nights for business.
en-unannotated-11269	Thousands of people have this problem, so no, stop trying to diagnose.
en-unannotated-11270	Very good hotel and great value for money.
en-unannotated-11271	She was able to talk with us in french and explained us the most importants things to see in Madrid.
en-unannotated-11272	Heston Blumenthal style, which was in a word "cool" (get it? liquid nitrogen? cool?)
en-unannotated-11273	It was soo good on first bite but it gets really creamy and oily as you eat it.
en-unannotated-11274	Cheap!!!
en-unannotated-11275	The place is lovely and not all so fancy to be off putting or anything.
en-unannotated-11276	I wouldn't have been so angry if a staff member had approach us at all during this time but it was clear that no one was monitoring the tables.
en-unannotated-11277	The best Coffee in Brisbane!
en-unannotated-11278	It is a great place to stay, very well located, it is very close to the Andino Mall.
en-unannotated-11279	Finally a good Fried chicken spot in Paris !
en-unannotated-11280	Hahaha
en-unannotated-11281	I will be back, hopefully it wont take me so long to get there again.
en-unannotated-11282	Walking distance to great restaurants and nightlife and metro stop.
en-unannotated-11283	Staff advised us that the air con is not available until June, and to open the doors!
en-unannotated-11284	We walked around and came back, now the line doubled and the bar was jammed packed.
en-unannotated-11285	I would skip the bread if you prefer warm bread with a soft bread center like I do.
en-unannotated-11286	I dare you not to like it!!!
en-unannotated-11287	It turned out to be a very good choice.
en-unannotated-11288	Den Noc is such a cute little spot!
en-unannotated-11289	App continually logs itself out.
en-unannotated-11290	No more place for the dessert 😩😩😩 looks so nice.
en-unannotated-11291	Meat was as I was expected, but cheesecake was the hero of the evening.
en-unannotated-11292	Walked in at 6:00 and were told that we could stay and eat at a table or the bar but they were fully booked starting at 7:00 and if we weren't done by then we would have to leave.
en-unannotated-11293	Somewhat good album archive.
en-unannotated-11294	This place could be as an example of perfect work in every "customer approach" material and in every "how to run succesfull butchery" book.
en-unannotated-11295	The staff was very friendly and helpful and the inside had awesome decor.
en-unannotated-11296	I had a taste of the pork belly burger (which comes on brioche with lettuce, tomato, gherkin, red onion, aioli) which used pork belly marinated in miso bean paste and was shredded then lightly fried to tender perfection and was insanely delicious.
en-unannotated-11297	I'm a fan of Melbourne's laneways, so I couldn't resist the call of the Survey Co - particularly on a cold and windy night!
en-unannotated-11298	We purchased about eight of the little mini pastries, mostly sampling several of their chocolate cakes.
en-unannotated-11299	This isn't necessarily bad (I suspect many were ex-pats rather than tourists), but maybe something to note if you're looking for a czech experience.
en-unannotated-11300	Also, the second bug is that it is laggy as hell.
en-unannotated-11301	We ordered all the ceviche in the menu and it was the most delicious and fresh ceviche we've ever had.
en-unannotated-11302	This place seems to be always packed, reservations are recommended!
en-unannotated-11303	It's a unique experience and definitely worth it!
en-unannotated-11304	We live in LA and this crushed Beverly Hills cuisine.
en-unannotated-11305	On first visit I was hooked though - despite the size and having to wait for seating, Miel delivers on all fronts.
en-unannotated-11306	Both came out on slate platters - slightly more practical than the wooden boards which every other hip place about town - with a generous side serve of chips and aioli.
en-unannotated-11307	The atmosphere is incredible, opulent and charming.
en-unannotated-11308	The location is perfect, very close to Spanish Steps.
en-unannotated-11309	This was an amazing way to end a long day of flights, trains, metro stops, ferries, and visiting beautiful cathedrals and churches.
en-unannotated-11310	The sauce vierge was overloaded with vinegar and lemon, easily overpowering the rest of the dish.
en-unannotated-11311	a nice location by Tuttle crossing
en-unannotated-11312	Bottom line if you come to Brussels and want an authentic experience with great food and beer you can't go wrong here.
en-unannotated-11313	Though it is good as per plot, but it could be better.
en-unannotated-11314	You really think I want a bunch on weirdos on a "dating" app to be able to creep on me?
en-unannotated-11315	This is a typical Embassy Suites.
en-unannotated-11316	The service is fast and the dishes delicious.
en-unannotated-11317	I have a good internet connection, but it doesn't work at all.
en-unannotated-11318	I highly recommend you to book a table at Con Garcia.
en-unannotated-11319	Personally I had the orange blossom and hazelnut and it was just...
en-unannotated-11320	This restaurant surpassed anything I've had in DC and probably NY since the ingredients were so fresh.
en-unannotated-11321	The hotel is a very ols and antique design, but felt like they do not maintain it well, the bed was full of hairs and very uncomfortable to sleep in, walls falling appart, smell of dust and oldnes everywere, we complaind and they upgraded us to a joniur suit with a big balcony, which was nice at the end.
en-unannotated-11322	Outstanding wine pairing again.
en-unannotated-11323	The hotel location is right off highway and in close proximity to many restaurants/gas and shopping.
en-unannotated-11324	One of the best mexican food restaurants in town, for ages, which has managed to stay away from current fashion of Rock star chefs ramping up in mexico city.
en-unannotated-11325	I came across this place one early morning and decided to enter, since I was not pleased with what my hotel could offer for breakfast.
en-unannotated-11326	Close to Kroger or restaurants.
en-unannotated-11327	I wouldn't recommend the creme brûlée.
en-unannotated-11328	All and all, it seemed like a once in a million chance because the place is very well maintained.
en-unannotated-11329	Excellent bottle of wine for little money.
en-unannotated-11330	We did the traditional tasting menu with wine pairing.
en-unannotated-11331	We ordered the special with tea and croissant.
en-unannotated-11332	There's a menu for items to enjoy with the beer, so we ordered grilled cheese with pesto and roasted peppers (actual grilled pieces of cheese) and a cheese assortment with homemade fig jam.
en-unannotated-11333	Ask for a room higher up to avoid music from the surrounding bars which may disturb some people.
en-unannotated-11334	If you are looking for a nice, slow, relaxing lunch this is a good place to stop.
en-unannotated-11335	The experience is also important.
en-unannotated-11336	Pivovar U Tří růží is close to the Karlova action but nestled away on a quiet side street.
en-unannotated-11337	One of the best restaurants i have ever been.
en-unannotated-11338	Read a review that suggested you sit in the kitchen, so we requested that.
en-unannotated-11339	Love the game to death , is a great way to pass the time with friends .
en-unannotated-11340	This place is huge with 3 dining areas: a bar in the front, a large smoking room, then a non-smoking room.
en-unannotated-11341	This is the oldest pub in Ireland and it's full of character.
en-unannotated-11342	A five course dinner plus a wine cocktail and a red wine with the dinner.
en-unannotated-11343	Last time my table was at 8:00pm but I got a group of 15people dined with me...
en-unannotated-11344	The pool & spa are relaxing.
en-unannotated-11345	Everything is geared to bump up pricing.
en-unannotated-11346	Don't waste you time ordering any other dessert.
en-unannotated-11347	And yes, I get it, its awesome.
en-unannotated-11348	Went for dinner, the garden is just amazing, the restaurant is English style, very formal and elegant!
en-unannotated-11349	However, I think this gastropub is slightly overrated.
en-unannotated-11350	My partner and I stayed at this fab hotel in Zona Rosa.
en-unannotated-11351	Great spot for a casual brunch date.
en-unannotated-11352	The pancakes were all amazing.
en-unannotated-11353	The waiter did mess our order up slightly but the service was great so can't complain.
en-unannotated-11354	It's a tiny velue that gets very busy but the line goes quickly.
en-unannotated-11355	On our table we sampled the 3 different tasting menus....
en-unannotated-11356	Our picky 7 y.o. son got the foie ravioli and he loved it.
en-unannotated-11357	It's cozy and laid back, yet has a vibe that makes you feel like your apart of the heart of Dublin.
en-unannotated-11358	luckily we were able to get a seat within 15 mins.
en-unannotated-11359	Our server, Jules, was charming, helpful, and delightful.
en-unannotated-11360	everyone who comes to the restaurant is clearly a tourist....
en-unannotated-11361	To die for chocolates!
en-unannotated-11362	The lobby and the stairs
en-unannotated-11363	We had boar burgers, goulash in a bread bowl, and a delicious chicken special with mashed parsnips.
en-unannotated-11364	Service was fast and professional.
en-unannotated-11365	The star was the pork knee which had such a crispy skin it reminded me of good lechon back in America.
en-unannotated-11366	If you are looking for a real intimate authentic Catalan adventure Evohe is the place to go.
en-unannotated-11367	What a wonderful experience!
en-unannotated-11368	Fair amount of seating outside and inside.
en-unannotated-11369	Good hotel, really good location, friendly helpful staff.
en-unannotated-11370	Just wonderful.
en-unannotated-11371	Restaurant has a set menu of two choices for each course.
en-unannotated-11372	It was cool to drink in the historic venue, but we won't return.
en-unannotated-11373	But totally worth it if you a fan of coffee and special places.
en-unannotated-11374	The food was good but the onion rings were perfection!
en-unannotated-11375	Main: King Fish cooked 2 ways.
en-unannotated-11376	Just like other capital cities, Brisbane too has a thriving but subtle laneway culture.
en-unannotated-11377	There was too much noise from the music of the street every morning.
en-unannotated-11378	After dessert, we were given small glasses of Chartreuse verte, a sweet herbal liquor - perfect!
en-unannotated-11379	Overall each of the dishes we ordered very much lacked in flavor.
en-unannotated-11380	Tuna Tartare with green tomato and a Jerusalem artichokes Im not a person to eat cold fish, but I gave this a go and I was very satisfied with the choice - Its a must do item on the menu.
en-unannotated-11381	Not sure why everyone's complaining of ads when you watch these programmes on the TV you have to see ads lol.
en-unannotated-11382	The waiters are incredibly and give a very good service.
en-unannotated-11383	Waitstaff were friendly and attentive.
en-unannotated-11384	Gonna use Uber from now on.
en-unannotated-11385	We also had the opportunity to try the risolatte dessert with cake and that was also very good.
en-unannotated-11386	Service was prompt and friendly and it was clear that the...
en-unannotated-11387	Service excellent.
en-unannotated-11388	Location was great!
en-unannotated-11389	But cup of coffee improved it, so everything was just perfect.
en-unannotated-11390	I then had a sublime pasta with tuna and lemon.
en-unannotated-11391	You really can't go wrong!
en-unannotated-11392	Our room was large and recently remodeled -It still smelled new
en-unannotated-11393	We were on the ground floor which is the pharmacy hall.
en-unannotated-11394	The hostess at door is so beautiful and friendly.
en-unannotated-11395	I thought I had good shrimp tacos before, but these just blew me away (they are also quite spicy!).
en-unannotated-11396	None of us have ever had a multi course dinner served by the chef.
en-unannotated-11397	The sides were just as tasty and complimented well, although, as previously mentioned, they were a little too much for one person.
en-unannotated-11398	It's a global appreciation if you can serve it right, but still- nobody is fu**ing with em!
en-unannotated-11399	I am not surprised by the raving reviews by my fellow Yelpers.
en-unannotated-11400	Samsung J6 running And 5.1.1
en-unannotated-11401	Overall a great experience, I would come back.
en-unannotated-11402	This place is also byow so I'll definitely be returning with more friends for dinner.
en-unannotated-11403	I had the filet of duck and it was excellent.
en-unannotated-11404	I also liked soaking the bread and potato dumplings in it.
en-unannotated-11405	The hotel is close to everything- beach, old town and shopping area.
en-unannotated-11406	Shouldn't have to get skips for your own playlist.
en-unannotated-11407	P Mac's is a nice place.
en-unannotated-11408	Service: We arrived about 30 minutes after Brew opened up for business.
en-unannotated-11409	Overall Very Good experience!
en-unannotated-11410	Although this is a very safe option for those looking to try Prague food.
en-unannotated-11411	I'm no stranger to eating gizzards, which I don't care much for since I find their texture too chewy.
en-unannotated-11412	I just want to extend my gratitude to Las Alcobas for the impeccable stay both my partner & I had.
en-unannotated-11413	And their are like 9M levels.
en-unannotated-11414	Super fail.
en-unannotated-11415	I drank the menu and nothing stood out as excellent.
en-unannotated-11416	Great selection of authentic Russian dishes!
en-unannotated-11417	The Mozzarella was on the hard side and the tomatoes were tasteless.
en-unannotated-11418	They opened the kitchen for us to get food after another place didnt provide what weird ordered!
en-unannotated-11419	if I felt rewarded, that is.
en-unannotated-11420	Excellent location.
en-unannotated-11421	The dessert was delightful.
en-unannotated-11422	the setting is amazing, food not as good as cafe pushkin.
en-unannotated-11423	Polite and helpful staff
en-unannotated-11424	Def my fav meal in Prague so far!
en-unannotated-11425	I don't think my choices were as good.
en-unannotated-11426	Friendly, helpful staff.
en-unannotated-11427	The escargot were amazing as was my husbands duck.
en-unannotated-11428	The paintwork all needed to be refreshed (at the very least - stripped and start again would be better). So that all made it bad value for money, despite the location.
en-unannotated-11429	My mate ordered the pork belly - he loved the food!
en-unannotated-11430	Sweet and savory, a perfect starter to the duck on duck on duck meal we're about to get down with!
en-unannotated-11431	Mincova is to Czech cuisine as gastropubs are to American.
en-unannotated-11432	The mezcal was unique and delicious, the food was flavorful and fantastic.
en-unannotated-11433	Well located, all the attractions just a short walk away.
en-unannotated-11434	This place is great!!
en-unannotated-11435	It had the usual ensemble of butter, garlic and parsley; but it also had a little bit of heavy cream and Chanterelle mushrooms which gave it some body and texture.
en-unannotated-11436	I also wanted to split a sweet pancake and the server recommended the cinnamon, brown sugar, butter and banana pancakes so we went with that.
en-unannotated-11437	Loly's highly experienced technique allows one to taste the very best vegan food...
en-unannotated-11438	Vrry misleading picture of roof terace on website.
en-unannotated-11439	The 'all day' buffet was much appreciated.
en-unannotated-11440	Great music great dècore.
en-unannotated-11441	There were several requirements that an hotel must met i order to be considerer like a valualbe alternative for stying there:
en-unannotated-11442	Will definitely return.
en-unannotated-11443	We got there for late lunch and it was still very crowded.
en-unannotated-11444	Its a fun game but sometimes the controls can be really tricky if you don't hit them just right.
en-unannotated-11445	I could not ask for more from restaurant.
en-unannotated-11446	Hotel staff was extremely pleasant and helpful.
en-unannotated-11447	on a rainy weekday morning and decided we need to eat, one quick Yelp search later and wow.
en-unannotated-11448	Room 565 a disaster no real air con broken telephone changed into room 562 just about the size of the bed!!!
en-unannotated-11449	This is an absolutely lovely small café with delicious homemade pastries, pizzas and Italian desserts.
en-unannotated-11450	Assiette de foie gras de canard Maison | Seared duck foie gras with chutney, toast, and house salad
en-unannotated-11451	What an experience!
en-unannotated-11452	No real complaints.
en-unannotated-11453	Nothing was explained on hotel infrastructure, breakfast time, gym etc.
en-unannotated-11454	Especially that time bar that will never end and just make us loosing time.
en-unannotated-11455	Clean, comfortable, and generally a good place with an excellent location but not the best value for your money.
en-unannotated-11456	Yay!
en-unannotated-11457	The other reviews aren't a hoax, it is a delightful place to spend one dinner in Paris.
en-unannotated-11458	If you are not in the neighborhood, it's definitely not worth a trip coming over.
en-unannotated-11459	This is one of the best restaurants in the area.
en-unannotated-11460	Electrical issues early am.
en-unannotated-11461	Delightful Bellinis, gorgeous surrounding, why absolutely wouldn't you?
en-unannotated-11462	Asked the server and she invited me to try it - it lights up something in the server area, no sound.
en-unannotated-11463	The building is old and very stylish, nevertheless the hotel rooms are modern and offer any comfort you may wish.
en-unannotated-11464	And when the guest comes he will win alwayas
en-unannotated-11465	It went down real nicely with our beers.
en-unannotated-11466	A day to remember
en-unannotated-11467	THE Survey Co.
en-unannotated-11468	Service was excellent as well.
en-unannotated-11469	You get to play four levels out of 30 then you must pay $10 to keep playing.
en-unannotated-11470	I DREAM of this dish, day in day out.
en-unannotated-11471	I couldn't finish them both, so I guess the right portion is 1.5 servings of pancakes?
en-unannotated-11472	Cute chef in the kitchen too ladies!
en-unannotated-11473	The location was excellent and the staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating.
en-unannotated-11474	Sure,...
en-unannotated-11475	Food looked ok but the male waiter was horrible so we went elsewhere
en-unannotated-11476	Have tried removing from apps list (In store) and muting (gplay) to no effect.
en-unannotated-11477	We had the tasting menu and were blown away with every course.
en-unannotated-11478	Graphics are pretty much the same as New Super Mario Bros.
en-unannotated-11479	A brilliant way to celebrate the Catalan hospitality.
en-unannotated-11480	This was one of my favorite meals.
en-unannotated-11481	It had lamb meat and potatoes and carrots served with 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.
en-unannotated-11482	It is a classical visit for a great Mexican traditional lunch.
en-unannotated-11483	The standard rooms were very small and shabby and poorly equipped.
en-unannotated-11484	The staff also deserve a shout out - they are always friendly and welcoming and top off a fabulous experience.
en-unannotated-11485	Their cocktails are a bit pricier than other bars, however they are well made and worth the money.
en-unannotated-11486	I was excited to try this place after the review.
en-unannotated-11487	Had a great time.
en-unannotated-11488	The salad on the side was also simple but really good.
en-unannotated-11489	The El Dorado theme of the hotel is a nice touch.
en-unannotated-11490	Lavender hot chocolate & chai hot chocolate are both winners in Sara's books.
en-unannotated-11491	Great atmosphere, good beer selection and the brew burger was fantastic.
en-unannotated-11492	The hotel is located in an excellent part of Bogota, close to some really nice restaurants.
en-unannotated-11493	The beers here seemed to be on the more expensive side.
en-unannotated-11494	go for the ambiance of the old monastery...
en-unannotated-11495	Being right across the street from the Bosque de Chapultapec was a real bonus.
en-unannotated-11496	Nice and fresh.
en-unannotated-11497	The restaurant is small, but that's what makes it charming.
en-unannotated-11498	What an experience and what an evening.
en-unannotated-11499	I struggled for about 30 minutes to find this place yesterday but it was sooooo worth it.
en-unannotated-11500	Easy walking distance to Bellas Artes, Palacio Nacional, and other highlights.
en-unannotated-11501	For our mains I got the duck breast with balsamic sauce and [NAME] ordered the duck Shepherds Pie.
en-unannotated-11502	The Mixed Sausage was three sausages accompanied by whipped horseradish sauce.
en-unannotated-11503	tv is old.
en-unannotated-11504	Our concierge recommended this restaurant.
en-unannotated-11505	m on weekends so you don't miss out.
en-unannotated-11506	Just terrible.
en-unannotated-11507	Stayed here on 26th and 27th September and could not fault the place.
en-unannotated-11508	Hate to give it 2 stars because it is a cool place and has a good beer selection.
en-unannotated-11509	Long story short, if you're going to head over to Ireland's oldest pub, stick to drinks.
en-unannotated-11510	The wait staff there are amazing and friendly and saw through our ruse to try and be sophisticated straight away.
en-unannotated-11511	A little bit crowded,: it's Arbat.
en-unannotated-11512	For $10.50 - $14 you get a top notch burger including a generous side serve of crispy herbed chips and a side of aioli.
en-unannotated-11513	We chose this hotel because it was close to the airport.
en-unannotated-11514	Make sure if you do order this, get it with the hazelnut ice...
en-unannotated-11515	We had excellent service and tasty food.
en-unannotated-11516	Otherwise sleeping arrangements very good.
en-unannotated-11517	I LOVED that upon check in they give you a smartphone that has wifi all over the city!
en-unannotated-11518	What a super cute place this was and it ended up being one of my favorites during our week+ visit.
en-unannotated-11519	The Corsican specialties were beautifully cooked and the service was professional but not at all stuffy.
en-unannotated-11520	The service is excellent and the staff are very friendly.
en-unannotated-11521	the faciitys were fantastic although the gym was a little small but it still had very modern equipment and the restaurant and buffet breakfast was fantastic.
en-unannotated-11522	Amazing place to stay.
en-unannotated-11523	We had the chefs menu, oysters, pan seared Turbo, and Lobster ravioli.
en-unannotated-11524	Loved it all
en-unannotated-11525	The waitress was nice and said if we could wait a little bit longer.
en-unannotated-11526	The servers are efficient and responsive.
en-unannotated-11527	The beauty and character of Hotel Orfila is only surpassed by the service of the staff.
en-unannotated-11528	The St Regis Mexico City is located in a great location, close to all attractions.
en-unannotated-11529	The staff is friendly, (love [NAME] the bartender!)
en-unannotated-11530	[name] comes out and explains to you every concept of the food,...
en-unannotated-11531	The safe was literally on the closet floor and difficult to reach and program.
en-unannotated-11532	I ordered the Dublin Coddle (sausage, bacon, and potato stew) and thought it was comforting and delicious (and reminded me of chicken stew). The bacon was not like American bacon, tit was more like a ham.
en-unannotated-11533	A couple of Canadians looking for a great dinning experience in Madrid.
en-unannotated-11534	The 9-ball game mode should have professional rule which include losing after commiting three consecutive fouls.
en-unannotated-11535	The amount of space inside leaves a little to be desired, but considering the location, quality, and overall feel of the place, this is easily overlooked.
en-unannotated-11536	A treat after a delightful stroll in the Tuileries Gardens.
en-unannotated-11537	5. Overall good pricing for the meal amd drinks you get.
en-unannotated-11538	I ended up at Peklo with my husband after we were not permitted entry into the monastery because they were closed for a private function.
en-unannotated-11539	I liked the place, even though my order was not that good.
en-unannotated-11540	The app is virtually unusable right now and will not let me swipe.
en-unannotated-11541	The game is FUN, the music is GOOD, the gameplay is SIMPLE YET SATISFYING, but there's not enough substance for a game that costs $10. With only 24 levels, the game is very short.
en-unannotated-11542	We were on our way from the Jewish quarter to the Dancing House when we got hungry and stopped here on a Yelp whim.
en-unannotated-11543	The breakfast is adequate.
en-unannotated-11544	I love the location and the rooms / lounge have been improved
en-unannotated-11545	When you go to San Sebastian for the weekend you don't need a lot.
en-unannotated-11546	This was bad.
en-unannotated-11547	Really pleasant and friendly ..
en-unannotated-11548	Spam
en-unannotated-11549	Chose to go here since it was one of the higest rated Milan resraurants on Trip Advisor.
en-unannotated-11550	Andoni and Giovanni were fantastic in assisting with our requests.
en-unannotated-11551	We arrived starving in the evening.
en-unannotated-11552	The two sisters who own and operate this hem of a restaurant are charming and their food is delicious.
en-unannotated-11553	In addition the ambience was lively and it was nice eating at an actual brewery.
en-unannotated-11554	Once they figured out we had a reservation they moved us to our own table but I didn't mind the seating either way.
en-unannotated-11555	The menu itself consists of a range of traditions and modern Japanese dishes.
en-unannotated-11556	Yet every meals were bit over evaluated...
en-unannotated-11557	Despite the fact that the Irish love this staple food to the point of distraction, they really do know how to elevate a spud into culinary art in a million different ways.
en-unannotated-11558	They charge a lot for bread, which isn't good.
en-unannotated-11559	Sometimes the queue is quite long and you wish you...
en-unannotated-11560	Which would be fun as an endurance option.
en-unannotated-11561	A clean well organised basic hotel with attentive staff.
en-unannotated-11562	Overall, the food is good.
en-unannotated-11563	Wished we ordered a dozen I couldn't get enough of these slippery little suckers!
en-unannotated-11564	Beautiful.
en-unannotated-11565	A cute restaurant that has an ample list of entrees but I focused my attention on the specials.
en-unannotated-11566	This is the best place to get foie gras in the world.
en-unannotated-11567	A definite must have!
en-unannotated-11568	The undeniable miss of the night was the duck - it was dry and lacked any distinct flavour, despite how beautiful the presentation was, and the service.
en-unannotated-11569	But overall, good app
en-unannotated-11570	I was close to crying...
en-unannotated-11571	An evening with 3 groups of strangers in a quirky, creative, grungy warehouse setting sitting around a common table in front of Xavi and Nico's kitchen.
en-unannotated-11572	We tried three other ones, and they were just ok,...
en-unannotated-11573	Scallops were tiny and salty with absolutely a confused taste.
en-unannotated-11574	Room changed to a smaller one with no drawers for stacking clothes.
en-unannotated-11575	When looking at other peoples pastas though they all looked really good and the people next to us finished every bit of it, so maybe we just ordered the wrong pasta.
en-unannotated-11576	The goulash was good.
en-unannotated-11577	#delish
en-unannotated-11578	We visited the snack side as we have been doing for years.
en-unannotated-11579	The guy speak English and are really into coffee as they even toast their own....
en-unannotated-11580	For dinner, I went with the mussels as my app, followed by the fish and chips.
en-unannotated-11581	Cannot say enough about it!
en-unannotated-11582	There isn't an English menu but our waiter was happy to answer any questions we had.
en-unannotated-11583	Enjoy!
en-unannotated-11584	By far the BEST hot chocolate I've ever had in my life.
en-unannotated-11585	I checked the storage, the current used is still 6.5gb but I could not play any songs I downloaded.
en-unannotated-11586	Very tasty блинчики с творогом.
en-unannotated-11587	Definitely recommend and glad we stumbled upon this place and got to enjoy it for our last meal in Paris.
en-unannotated-11588	We had what the owner recommended including chicken brochettes, Corsican burgers and lasagne.
en-unannotated-11589	Hotel staff was helpful and attentive and tried to make sure we were taken care of.
en-unannotated-11590	An incredible hidden gem.
en-unannotated-11591	old furniture.
en-unannotated-11592	The cocktail maker extraordinaire knows what he is doing from smoking the honey, to mixing the perfect blend of honey infused cocktails for a taste sensation.
en-unannotated-11593	The wine list is limited but with interesting choices.
en-unannotated-11594	We were looking forward to a return visit.
en-unannotated-11595	Between the table we sampled organic potatoes (drowning in butter, as they should be), seasonal greens (crisply blanched), beef cheek (falling apart in its tenderness), eye fillet (cooked to perfection with a great accompanying salsa-type thing) and lamb rump (amazing teamed with pickled eggplant). All in all, a lovely restaurant for a special occasion or just to treat yourself.
en-unannotated-11596	Chef Rodrigo and his staff are passionate about giving the best quality food and service.
en-unannotated-11597	We had no idea the history of the hotel, which was a wonderful surprise.
en-unannotated-11598	But this bagel made me a fan of haloumi!
en-unannotated-11599	The only take back is that while delicious, their burgers are difficult to eat (as in the insides are usually popping out the bottom and sides as I eat and I am always scrapping up bits as I go).
en-unannotated-11600	Zero compaints and I added zero calories due to the freshness of everything .
en-unannotated-11601	The cherry tomatoes were amazingly sweet; the other was rather tasteless.
en-unannotated-11602	Stayed in Room 107 on ground floor.
en-unannotated-11603	Done Deal is in my opinion the number 1 online selling site in Ireland - the others are insignificant by comparison
en-unannotated-11604	Their seafood is really good, the atmosphere of the place is hip, very nice looking place and the service is great.
en-unannotated-11605	- Dirty room, with stairs, hair, broken bits;
en-unannotated-11606	Try the shrimps with wassabi sauce.
en-unannotated-11607	Well our spinach side was kind of cold and one time I got the apple strudel and it tasted onion-y, though I don't think it was at this location...
en-unannotated-11608	The gratins are simply delicious- so buttery, garlicky, cheesy, and flavorful.
en-unannotated-11609	The hotel is truly beautiful, my only recommendations would be to double check bedrooms to make sure they're clean and some maintanence is required for little touches.
en-unannotated-11610	His nephew, the host, was very friendly and spoke enough English to help us make selections.
en-unannotated-11611	This place was so good I almost don't want to write a review and let out "the secret.
en-unannotated-11612	This is more than a five star hotel.
en-unannotated-11613	The service was amazing, I have no words for it and therefore I gladly payed the coperto!
en-unannotated-11614	Would definitely recommend.
en-unannotated-11615	Stayed here for one week on a room only basis, but the hotel, room and staff were all excellent.
en-unannotated-11616	We tried to book a table upstairs but it was not...
en-unannotated-11617	Ordered the escargot, prawns and scallops and pork shoulder and everything was absolutely delicious.
en-unannotated-11618	Second, love the decor, really rustic and cabin looking.
en-unannotated-11619	My suite has a living room and sleeping room wit additional bathroom and entrance space.
en-unannotated-11620	I was a little disoriented at mealtime, so my recollection is a little foggy and I didn't have a 100% appetite, but I found this to be a pretty solid option if you are in this area of the city.
en-unannotated-11621	Interesting tasty dishes, presented with care and served in a friendly and understanding manner.
en-unannotated-11622	The management of the queue was the least effective I have ever experienced - the cafe is a big place with tall ceilings, it has only 8...
en-unannotated-11623	Quantity also quite large.
en-unannotated-11624	Definitely share the pork knee.
en-unannotated-11625	Vine and beer made localy.
en-unannotated-11626	Lovely environment and food
en-unannotated-11627	So I feel like it's mislabeled in TripAdvisor, setting it up for...
en-unannotated-11628	I already did!
en-unannotated-11629	The staff friendly and sweet
en-unannotated-11630	The pate plate was good (esp for the price), the duck was wonderfully cooked in the middle, but the exterior was not crispy, so realize that before you order.
en-unannotated-11631	They duplicated payments and refused to use the pre-authorization payment, rather they wanted a new payment.
en-unannotated-11632	Try out Brew for a leisurely brunch date, or perhaps a drink with that friend from Sydney who claims that Brisbane "just doesn't have as much culture".
en-unannotated-11633	Very clean and comfortable.
en-unannotated-11634	This is a good hotel choice if you don't mind being a bit further from the city centre.
en-unannotated-11635	They have wifi and also parking assistance outside.
en-unannotated-11636	Prices were good and the food quality was decent.
en-unannotated-11637	Cool staff.
en-unannotated-11638	Over all I do recommend you play this game.
en-unannotated-11639	The service was outstanding - attentive but unobtrusive.
en-unannotated-11640	Tried the shrimp with avocado, the meat and a lime pie.
en-unannotated-11641	Location.
en-unannotated-11642	Rooms are old , with basic furniture , in one room the fridge was on the top of the capenet imposible to reach .
en-unannotated-11643	Had the tasting menu for lunch here recently and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.
en-unannotated-11644	All in all I had a terrific experience and I would not hesitate to return again.
en-unannotated-11645	the restaurant was packed!!
en-unannotated-11646	The burger and the tartare are not to be missed.
en-unannotated-11647	Apartment needs some maintenance.
en-unannotated-11648	I want to say our server was also the owner of this little hidden gem and he was darling.
en-unannotated-11649	u can name yaself and chose how u want to move around your little or HUGE snake!
en-unannotated-11650	I couldn't decide on which dish so they made me one with both, including pear raviolli.
en-unannotated-11651	Everything is clean, and near the center, beach.
en-unannotated-11652	Amazing one of the Best meals in Paris and we ate alot.
en-unannotated-11653	The door had a sign indicating that they would accept all kinds of cards, including Discover!
en-unannotated-11654	Now, I never thought I'd be eating a pig's knee in the former Czechoslovakia, but this thing was roasted to a perfect tenderness the likes of which I may never have again.
en-unannotated-11655	Amazing evening - was there with my girlfriend and we were only 4 persons that night - two couples.
en-unannotated-11656	Since the pancakes weren't too overly sweet, you could really taste the delicious tart strawberries, mixed with the freshness from the mint and the creaminess of the mascarpone which was also drizzled with maple syrup.
en-unannotated-11657	I found this restaurant on trip advisor and had no idea the distance from Neptune's fountains, however it was worth the 17 minute taxi ride.
en-unannotated-11658	For dessert, we had cannelés.
en-unannotated-11659	People af the bar are friendly, food is good.
en-unannotated-11660	Cost was €69, room only (no breakfast).
en-unannotated-11661	The pancakes were fluffy and didn't get soggy.
en-unannotated-11662	The restaurant is very intimate in the sense that we were pretty much sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with another family.
en-unannotated-11663	I got the attention of a staff member and explained our excessive wait, and the fact that another couple arrived after us and were already eating.
en-unannotated-11664	No wait
en-unannotated-11665	We ordered the egg cocotte with duck foie gras (liver paté), the pork loin, and the crème brûlée.
en-unannotated-11666	Restaurant run by a couple who take you on a tasting journey during the course of the evening.
en-unannotated-11667	The third floor of GUM Mall, from the Ilinka.
en-unannotated-11668	We had 3 people and didn't have a reservation on a Friday night so we had to go to the restaurant next door.
en-unannotated-11669	Excuse me while I go spend the rest of my trip here.
en-unannotated-11670	- Bathroom in the main hall is very bad with very ugly smell.
en-unannotated-11671	The view from a Seaview room is phenomenal.
en-unannotated-11672	The location is central in town close to attractions, shopping, people.
en-unannotated-11673	The beds are very stiff and this hotel would benefit greatly by investing in a heavenly bed policy, probably the cheapest way to balance the scales on the negatives.
en-unannotated-11674	We had ceiling view window of original ceiling angels.
en-unannotated-11675	True - tiny room and tiny (spotless) bathroom in an old building.
en-unannotated-11676	Appetizer, primi and secondi AND desserts for everyone and don't forget the coffee!
en-unannotated-11677	I have a better internet connection FYI.
en-unannotated-11678	This is in close proximity to Notre Dame and the view outside was great.
en-unannotated-11679	A wonderful place to stay in Rome!
en-unannotated-11680	The restaurant is also small so try and make reservations in advance.
en-unannotated-11681	I didn't feel inclined to revisit after.
en-unannotated-11682	I will return when I come back to Paris.
en-unannotated-11683	And I'm ones of those people that I like it when I open Snapchat their is no purple.
en-unannotated-11684	My friends and I split some of their house brews, and they were all tasty too.
en-unannotated-11685	If miss this.
en-unannotated-11686	I love this game....
en-unannotated-11687	It was just so decadent and so creamy adn rich without being too heavy.
en-unannotated-11688	It's like going back year to be given largish keys!
en-unannotated-11689	Food: excellent
en-unannotated-11690	The table is so lovely and it already receives you with bread, olive oil and some apples.
en-unannotated-11691	This quirky little bar is a in a side street as you walk through the Gothic Quarter to the Port...
en-unannotated-11692	Also had the linguini and meatballs which was OK.
en-unannotated-11693	[NAME] our waiter was so nice, not pushy, and very attentive.
en-unannotated-11694	Department needs a thorough cleaning and painting.
en-unannotated-11695	N/A
en-unannotated-11696	Decided to book The Principal for two days before ny vacation with my bestie begins.
en-unannotated-11697	diners in evening dress, not nearly as full as pushkin, maybe a bit over the top?
en-unannotated-11698	It is all in the name, you have to love sweet bakery.
en-unannotated-11699	There's an option to shut off the in-game music but it will not let you play any other music simultaneously.
en-unannotated-11700	The pastry and bread selection is fantastic, and I loved the authentic shredded turkey dish.
en-unannotated-11701	The food was fresh and there was a great bar of toppings to put on top- limes, sauces, salsas, marinated onions, cabbage, etc etc.
en-unannotated-11702	What have your developers done!?
en-unannotated-11703	Bright and young atmosphere with really awesome friendly staff...
en-unannotated-11704	After almost a year in France I had to go to Corsica for the best rumstek (sic) in France.
en-unannotated-11705	It even include a bottle of wine!
en-unannotated-11706	It was so good.
en-unannotated-11707	For dessert, I had The Farm Surprise, which I'll keep to myself, which while it isn't quite on the level of spoiling you on the new Star Wars movie, is still a disservice to you as a diner.
en-unannotated-11708	The lighting in the room is too dark.
en-unannotated-11709	My friend and I came here in the mid afternoon for a late lunch, and boy were we in for a treat.
en-unannotated-11710	All appliances working perfectly, kitchen fully equipped even with basic ingredients (sugar, oil salt ext).
en-unannotated-11711	I've been to 2 of their locations and I definitely think that this is the better one.
en-unannotated-11712	Fresh and tasty!
en-unannotated-11713	Because of Boxty House's great reviews and proximity to my hotel, I was definitely tempted to try during my stay in Dublin.
en-unannotated-11714	Over Reforma in one of the most important streets in Mexico City, Capital Grille receives you with a great service and the opportunity to choose between great seafood and steak!
en-unannotated-11715	Great service too!!
en-unannotated-11716	You can get some coffee here that is prepared by the handsome Italian or his charming wife from Russia.
en-unannotated-11717	-Pastas: I got the frutti di mare and I made him get the lobster spaghetti so we could have the best of both worlds.
en-unannotated-11718	Both portions were huge which is highly unlikely for Italian restaurants.
en-unannotated-11719	Staff spoke English.
en-unannotated-11720	Before I wasn't the biggest fan of Macarons, but these were amaaaaazing.
en-unannotated-11721	Had my first dinner in milan here.
en-unannotated-11722	nothing to add here
en-unannotated-11723	Dog loved her too.
en-unannotated-11724	Excellent quality.
en-unannotated-11725	Best to go early.
en-unannotated-11726	You can choose to design your own burger, which is like Mickey Dees except a lot cheaper and far superior from every angle you look at it.
en-unannotated-11727	But from last night..
en-unannotated-11728	Extensive wine...
en-unannotated-11729	This is a business hotel with no charm that happens to be in the best area of Mexico City.
en-unannotated-11730	Meals were beautifully served, the duck was amazingly crispy, the traditional goulash met all our expectations.
en-unannotated-11731	The restaurant was very nice, clean, and the staff were all very nice and attentive.
en-unannotated-11732	Great service!
en-unannotated-11733	The place was located at the corner of a main square.
en-unannotated-11734	We saw the high Yelp rating and came for lunch.
en-unannotated-11735	Similarly, my daughter's scallops were very good, but the vegetable mix (leek, cauliflower, and some others I couldn't identify) was even better than the main course.
en-unannotated-11736	If your neaby do stop for this
en-unannotated-11737	It was absolutely delightful.
en-unannotated-11738	What a memorable experience!
en-unannotated-11739	The best way to recommend this place is to come in and check it out for yourself.
en-unannotated-11740	Beautiful hôtel in the historical center of Mexico city.
en-unannotated-11741	Pizza suggestions:...
en-unannotated-11742	Quaint restaurant that is well worth the time and effort to get there and be part of the family.
en-unannotated-11743	We went in March when it is safely out of mass tourism season.
en-unannotated-11744	Useless...
en-unannotated-11745	Their goat salad is phenomenal and the pretzel is amazing.
en-unannotated-11746	This is your spot, just plan ahead and you'll be golden.
en-unannotated-11747	The crab dishes were delicious, as well as all the seafood tapas.
en-unannotated-11748	That is why I like this game.
en-unannotated-11749	The beds, pillows and linens were the finest I've experienced in a hotel.
en-unannotated-11750	Even though they don't look like a lot, one stack is enough to fill you up.
en-unannotated-11751	The Mexican restaurant is superb!!
en-unannotated-11752	Will update my rating when fixed
en-unannotated-11753	Helpful.
en-unannotated-11754	The bread bowl was toasty and the meat stew was hearty and very flavorful.
en-unannotated-11755	Probably the best part of our meal.
en-unannotated-11756	This place also gets really busy.
en-unannotated-11757	keep trying do
en-unannotated-11758	The staff is really quick and welcoming.
en-unannotated-11759	I would definitely recommend this bistro for anyone who is looking for a cozy place to eat some comfort food in the Saint Michel area.
en-unannotated-11760	Bathroom fittings were old and corroded
en-unannotated-11761	close to the Spanish steps but there are numerouse other beatiful locations in Rome
en-unannotated-11762	it...
en-unannotated-11763	It was pan seared with drizzles of unsweet dark chocolate.
en-unannotated-11764	Always loads to see  good turnover of stuff
en-unannotated-11765	Difficult to fine a fine restaurant to book.
en-unannotated-11766	We arrived at 6.30pm, 30 minutes before the restaurant open, but they still served us and didn't tell us to wait until 7pm.
en-unannotated-11767	After the second call to the floor staff that were outside, the manager came to talk with me.
en-unannotated-11768	Rooms not turned down every night & towels replacement was not as often as we liked
en-unannotated-11769	I would certainly bring my wife here for a nice Italian dinning experience.
en-unannotated-11770	What steak is to the United States, duck is to France.
en-unannotated-11771	Shower a bit of an ordeal - lack of control over temperature.
en-unannotated-11772	I wish I could get robux from playing games.
en-unannotated-11773	- Very cheap quality amenities;
en-unannotated-11774	We loved it for a thousand reasons.
en-unannotated-11775	Service was great and pleasant- our waiter was memorable and we really enjoyed our experience here.
en-unannotated-11776	Liseth went out of her way to ensure my room was always clean, stocked and comfortable after a hard day at work.
en-unannotated-11777	Gorditas don't leave without trying .
en-unannotated-11778	The traffic is horrible.
en-unannotated-11779	So when heading to Brisvegas and exploring the city with a fellow coffee lover, I eagerly anticipated where we would be taken.
en-unannotated-11780	The pizza was very basic; the toppings seemed to be tossed onto the dough from a can.
en-unannotated-11781	I have had the goulash in 3-4 different locations in Prague.
en-unannotated-11782	Went for dinner on a Saturday night to celebrate my birthday!
en-unannotated-11783	Not as good as I hoped, but you Will find friendly staff, good sandwiches and coffee and juices.
en-unannotated-11784	Handy location.
en-unannotated-11785	First time in Mexico City and I loved this hotel.
en-unannotated-11786	We were not rushed and spent quite some time taking in the festive ambiance (it was a full house) and talking.
en-unannotated-11787	If I was in the area again I would stay there again
en-unannotated-11788	Because I saved a lots but downloaded only the ones I like (still hundreds songs). I don't want to use to download button for the whole library.
en-unannotated-11789	Restaurant is nice..
en-unannotated-11790	We went here last week, party of 3, we all went for burger special, with fried onions + cheese, starter of wings served with main course, even though we asked for them as a starter, burgers dried out, raw onions instead of fried, one of us sent back burger for fried onions to be added, got back burger hard as rock cheese hard disappeared, did I mention chips cold and tons of salt had been added, very disappointed!!
en-unannotated-11791	the best place in all Mexico, and impeccable customer service, the workers in here are so friendly and professional 24 hrs, the food was great!!!
en-unannotated-11792	Tonight we decided to go upstairs to the bar and try their accompanying food and drinks menu.
en-unannotated-11793	Organic and farm to table.
en-unannotated-11794	Gastropubs with hipster influences seemed to be the genre we frequented most while traveling abroad, and P.
en-unannotated-11795	Please provide this .
en-unannotated-11796	Majestic lounge area, feels like a ballroom from period dramas.
en-unannotated-11797	Dont mind the shelter and judge it just because its right off the street.
en-unannotated-11798	From the warm greeting by [NAME], to the excellent service and recommendations provided by [NAME], to the delicious food with generous portions, this place is an all around winner.
en-unannotated-11799	Took my girlfriend out here as a special going away dinner.
en-unannotated-11800	Had the asparagus and shrimp soup, my new ATF, and the barbecue ribeye was to die for.
en-unannotated-11801	The soup was amazing.
en-unannotated-11802	Its "garden level" location wraps itself around you and makes you feel like you could sit there for hours.
en-unannotated-11803	Please provide indian food at least twice in a week.
en-unannotated-11804	I can't recommend this place knowing there are many more with better food.
en-unannotated-11805	For a 5 star hotel the WIFI could be ALOT better, i could hardly get a connection for my iphone and the wifi wasnt doing any better, im guessing that it has only one WIFI for the whole hotel which is a big hotel and they should atleast have a router for each floor just to make it better, and you need to close the door of the room really hard to make sure it stays closed, other than that its amazing and was actually.
en-unannotated-11806	I would go back if I travel to Milan again.
en-unannotated-11807	My boyfriend and I came here to get the ice cream but instead ordered the cafe affogato and chocolate affogato.
en-unannotated-11808	Those in the know flock here during all times of the day for their claim-to-fame brunch and Les Classiques du Gout menu where you can't miss any of their classic specials.
en-unannotated-11809	Cool because it is so old, claims to be the oldest pub in Ireland.
en-unannotated-11810	I stayed here as part of a tour and everything at this hotel was wonderful.
en-unannotated-11811	This was a weekend stay.
en-unannotated-11812	Breakfast (huge choices) is included.
en-unannotated-11813	Where do I even begin!!??
en-unannotated-11814	And it's actually not that expensive for what you get.
en-unannotated-11815	Make a reservation or come right when they open, they were packed within minutes.
en-unannotated-11816	Ultimately, this game as it is just doesn't have enough substance to justify the $10 admission fee.
en-unannotated-11817	For dessert, we got brownie and it was decent.
en-unannotated-11818	Overall, a very good experience!
en-unannotated-11819	Very personable, this is a rare thing to experience these days.
en-unannotated-11820	Located in a small but super sweet store you can buy delicious treats.
en-unannotated-11821	We ordered a hot chocolate and latte macchiato, two orange juices, bread with butter and jam, and yogurt with granola to start.
en-unannotated-11822	So, we were thinking the Goulash set before us was uninspiring, but perhaps that is how the Czech like it.
en-unannotated-11823	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!
en-unannotated-11824	This hotel is located in a predominantly gay area.
en-unannotated-11825	Everything seemed fine when we placed an order for beers and a heap of food- again, we were starving from walking around all day in the heat.
en-unannotated-11826	I don't think there should be an uploading limit, but that's not why I'm here.
en-unannotated-11827	Highly recommend.
en-unannotated-11828	They have coffee, tea, and hot chocolate, and wifi!
en-unannotated-11829	I ended up with a quinoa salad with mozzarella and veggies, which was good, but not nearly as amazing as my starter (but to be fair, I had to ask them to accommodate me- maybe if they had more time to plan something out it would have been as spectacular as the starter). My boyfriend had the chicken dish, which he said was really good but was a little dry.
en-unannotated-11830	The description alone should stop you dead in your tracks!
en-unannotated-11831	The hotel does not have its own breakfast place which may be uncomfortable for some guests.
en-unannotated-11832	There were many innovative and risky plates, but everything worked out together great.
en-unannotated-11833	BS!
en-unannotated-11834	Despite not looking like large portions, we were quite full after the mains.
en-unannotated-11835	The food and ambience is fantastic.
en-unannotated-11836	El Cardenal in his Alameda restaurant is a great place to have a delicious Mexican house style food !
en-unannotated-11837	Our waitress was awesome!!
en-unannotated-11838	Found this place around the corner.
en-unannotated-11839	My My near Four Seasons Hotel end had a wider selection though.
en-unannotated-11840	They are constantly rotating between house blends and have 1 or 2 single origin options too.
en-unannotated-11841	One of the best risottos I've ever had.
en-unannotated-11842	Great lunch location.
en-unannotated-11843	I'm connected all the times...
en-unannotated-11844	I was in Brisbane this past week and was staying near Elizabeth Street.
en-unannotated-11845	Chilli, mint, peanut butter, etc.
en-unannotated-11846	The flavours of the sweet but ever so slightly bitter coffee syrup combined well with the creamy pannacotta, although the syrup appeared to cause it to break up a little.
en-unannotated-11847	This small place was packed on a Sunday night, and all of the tables were full.
en-unannotated-11848	I am choosing to give this game a 4(I just had to break my grading scale) because I like it its fun for kids and adults.
en-unannotated-11849	Overall, relatively clean but tired old hotel that needs a good lick of paint, a good scrub, and some maintenance.
en-unannotated-11850	I happen to love gin, so I ordered a gin and tonic.
en-unannotated-11851	Would go here every trip.
en-unannotated-11852	We have now had to experience and pay for the food and drink.
en-unannotated-11853	The problem was the service.
en-unannotated-11854	I ate A LOT so I should have felt sick but I didn't which is proof that they use good ingredients.
en-unannotated-11855	We sat down and had:
en-unannotated-11856	Also not able to have breakfast.
en-unannotated-11857	Probably best coffee I had and deserts on the level, too.
en-unannotated-11858	I ordered a Haloumi bagel, which had tomato, onion, spinach, pesto, chili jam, and Japanese mayo.
en-unannotated-11859	but I've got a severe food poisoning after dining in this particular place.
en-unannotated-11860	He had done all the planning in advance and booked a casual dinner at Midi 12 after reading how vegetarian friendly their menu is....
en-unannotated-11861	just sooooooooooo nice!
en-unannotated-11862	The service was great
en-unannotated-11863	A MUST to eat here!!!
en-unannotated-11864	very pleasant style on the hall, stairs, bar and breakfast
en-unannotated-11865	I don't want to have to use another photo gallery app besides this one ever again!
en-unannotated-11866	We had this dinner the night before the terrorist attacks and left to go back to NY the next morning - we send our thoughts and prayers to the restaurant and to all Parisians.
en-unannotated-11867	The photos show the best rooms and areas available.
en-unannotated-11868	I don't like messy.
en-unannotated-11869	The Chef and owner came out to the tables.
en-unannotated-11870	When l get in the guy in reception very unwelcome face told me to get out !
en-unannotated-11871	Was a daily user of Hailo.
en-unannotated-11872	[NAME] and I had dinner here the other weekend with some friends and we thoroughly enjoyed our food.
en-unannotated-11873	The...
en-unannotated-11874	Thanks
en-unannotated-11875	The...
en-unannotated-11876	Next time I go to Paris this is the first place where I want to eat.
en-unannotated-11877	I came here for a 2night stay and perfection does not even begin to describe it.
en-unannotated-11878	Normally I wouldn't stay in a hotel in the city where I live, but we were selling our house and did not want to continually keep the place clean during the showings.
en-unannotated-11879	Also had a cheese with our wine and it came on a lovely platter with condiments!
en-unannotated-11880	Very cool inside.
en-unannotated-11881	I have eaten many foie gras at many places but by far this is the best one.
en-unannotated-11882	Great, affordable, delicious food.
en-unannotated-11883	Breakfast not fantastic.
en-unannotated-11884	My fish was tasted great but was not as hot as I would have liked.
en-unannotated-11885	We knew it would be good when we had to wait to go up.
en-unannotated-11886	Im a big giy so eating is a big part of my life and normally takes a lot of fill me up and they did a great job.
en-unannotated-11887	Rooms were very spacious, shower was excellent.
en-unannotated-11888	My friend wasn't over enthused with her pork ribs since they were served lukewarm.
en-unannotated-11889	They offer two sets of menus( a fixed menu with choices and a tasting menu) with wine at relatively low price of 40-45 Euros per person.
en-unannotated-11890	Only 4 stars until then.
en-unannotated-11891	with French fries, go discover them.
en-unannotated-11892	it was sublime...
en-unannotated-11893	Pork with sweet potato is a must and very reasonable price (15...
en-unannotated-11894	We were not expecting to be stuffed after this meal, but we absolutely were.
en-unannotated-11895	The cupcakes all (carrot, peanut butter chocolate, and red velvet) seemed to be less than fresh.
en-unannotated-11896	Another instance where I have eaten more than I should.
en-unannotated-11897	Delicious and very reasonably priced.
en-unannotated-11898	The other half was the fillet with coconut dressing.
en-unannotated-11899	What an amazing experience.
en-unannotated-11900	I also suggest making a reservation since the restaurant is so small and has limited hours.
en-unannotated-11901	They ranked it as an up and coming hot spot in the city.
en-unannotated-11902	Hotel Niza overlooks the fabulous beach.
en-unannotated-11903	What was amazing?
en-unannotated-11904	Spam
en-unannotated-11905	Attenive staff in dining room and location
en-unannotated-11906	Both tasted a bit on the salty side
en-unannotated-11907	Almost at the very end of the harbour side, close to the ferry to Sardinia, this restaurant stands out as different from the hundreds of touristy places in Bonifacio.
en-unannotated-11908	I was minding my own business, shoving olives in my mouth and drinking house wine when I suddenly looked up and saw on the wall behind my friends' head....
en-unannotated-11909	An outstanding dining experience.
en-unannotated-11910	Parking is scarce in the area, so take a taxi, grab an uber, or walk if you have to, but eat here!
en-unannotated-11911	We found out about it on Yelp and I'm so glad we did.
en-unannotated-11912	Cappuccino + croissant?
en-unannotated-11913	The room was noisy, the window was not enough to isolate the noise of the garbage truck every night.
en-unannotated-11914	great location.
en-unannotated-11915	If we read previous reviews there are many people who have complained regarding this but still you people arent doing anything.
en-unannotated-11916	If you MUST eat in this area of town, Mincovna is a decent option.
en-unannotated-11917	Nice atmosphere.
en-unannotated-11918	El Cardenal, despite being a chain of restaurants, is a great place to eat.
en-unannotated-11919	We ordered more salad and it...
en-unannotated-11920	The hotel is a total of 4 suites set in one of the gracious old townhouses that line the block.
en-unannotated-11921	Of the three hotels on our tour,this was by far the best.
en-unannotated-11922	There is something so heartwarming about Eastern European cuisine, with food battered in beer, and meat so good it'd make any vegetarian reconsider their life choices.
en-unannotated-11923	And I was, what?
en-unannotated-11924	The food and service were amazing.
en-unannotated-11925	Hôtel is way too old.
en-unannotated-11926	The photos were very misleading, this is at best a 3* property, not 5* unless it closes for a year and completely renovates.
en-unannotated-11927	When I say Italians know how to eat and they eat a LOT, I mean it!
en-unannotated-11928	Pickled Brie cheese
en-unannotated-11929	Good good, good service, what more can one say?
en-unannotated-11930	Better cake!!
en-unannotated-11931	Going here is a must.
en-unannotated-11932	Truly excellent bed and very nice views on the city from the terrace.
en-unannotated-11933	The quality of food was below average.
en-unannotated-11934	That sucker is huge and definitely meant to share with ample amount of beer.
en-unannotated-11935	Bathroom was large with rain type shower head and towel warmer.
en-unannotated-11936	Very large twin beds with additional pillows and blankets if required.
en-unannotated-11937	The service is impeccable.
en-unannotated-11938	Pastries are 6-9 EUR.
en-unannotated-11939	I had the broccoli and goat cheese soup to start and the cheese was super subtle and smooth.
en-unannotated-11940	Dinner and drinks were prompt.
en-unannotated-11941	Join the queue and sample a wide range of treats.
en-unannotated-11942	Located across the street from the Atocha train station, 2 minute walk.
en-unannotated-11943	My friends had the burgers, sandwiches and pasta and were all very satisfied with the quality.
en-unannotated-11944	Our table put us essentially in the kitchen, able to watch the one-man-band in the kitchen prepare, cook, plate and generally care for each dish.
en-unannotated-11945	But not the case this time.
en-unannotated-11946	Well worth the price.
en-unannotated-11947	Traditional Czech food, Czech beers, and great prices!
en-unannotated-11948	All I can say is , just come , you'll see what I mean.
en-unannotated-11949	We made a mistake, and needed one more night.
en-unannotated-11950	Wi-fi hopeless - do not bother
en-unannotated-11951	I have never made a reservation 6 months in advance before, but I knew this place would be something special.
en-unannotated-11952	I've tried to get a taxi with Mytaxi several times in Barcelona but will give up using this app.
en-unannotated-11953	Our waiter came by and took our drink order- no cocktails served here which is the only downside to this restaurant.
en-unannotated-11954	There's a delicious variety of sweet and savory pancakes to choose from, and the flavors are very unique.
en-unannotated-11955	10/10! The food was fantastic!
en-unannotated-11956	) doesn't want to overcomplicated choices when she can concentrate on making those fresh ingredients really shine with some special TLC.
en-unannotated-11957	I can only recommend!
en-unannotated-11958	I am brave, I am a Foodie with a capital F, and I wanted to try this typical French dish.
en-unannotated-11959	The owners are very friendly, food is very good and the best: it´s all bio and if possible out of the own garden or the region.
en-unannotated-11960	Always good quality and they never burn the milk!
en-unannotated-11961	The hotel location is excellent and the staff are very very helpful.
en-unannotated-11962	:)
en-unannotated-11963	It was served over a single, large cube of ice with a twist of orange and lemon peel carefully swirled along the edge of each glass.
en-unannotated-11964	Got disconnected but other apps are working fine.
en-unannotated-11965	poor reception and front desk area.
en-unannotated-11966	Very convenient location.
en-unannotated-11967	And considering it is in the heart of Temple Bar, the food is worth the trip.
en-unannotated-11968	This Hotel is absolutely beautiful from the moment you walk in.
en-unannotated-11969	Also came with bread for dipping.
en-unannotated-11970	Sorry, I worked all day and this guy (probably discriminating me with the type of the other people with the way he was staring at me) in a naive and amateur action judges me with so sure of himself that I am drunk and don't let me in (because I stepped on him, uaaaauuuuu) while people stepping everywhere drunk are allowed to enter.
en-unannotated-11971	Good central location.
en-unannotated-11972	Incredible tasting menu with fusions of international and Spanish ingredients.
en-unannotated-11973	Beautiful architecture within the hotel itself and orange terrace is beautiful of an evening
en-unannotated-11974	Friendly staff on arrival.
en-unannotated-11975	The city is known for it cannelloni and we found a great place to try it.
en-unannotated-11976	On top of that, some of the dishes weren't very good.
en-unannotated-11977	Negatives...
en-unannotated-11978	Bathroom lighting was inadequate.
en-unannotated-11979	We sort of went crazy with our orders, getting the prosciutto and cherry tomato pancakes, the peanut butter and jelly pancakes, the cheese and egg pancakes, the mushroom and goat cheese pancakes, AND the pork and spinach pancakes.
en-unannotated-11980	The location is not the best but you can take a cab and be in nice places in 15 - 20 minutes.
en-unannotated-11981	Discussions with the service personnel was very unfriendly and not solution oriented.
en-unannotated-11982	The wine one of the best we tasted in Barcelona!
en-unannotated-11983	Still a nice place with good breakfast buffet.
en-unannotated-11984	The meat was a bit too dry to our taste, and although it was accompanied with sauce (the ribs as well as the duck) the overall flavour should have been stronger.
en-unannotated-11985	Reception staff was very welcoming.
en-unannotated-11986	The building has lots of character and fun paintings on the wall.
en-unannotated-11987	Our drivers have all been pleasant.
en-unannotated-11988	All in the wonderful atmosphere of the Gogol House Museum on Nikitsky Bulvar.
en-unannotated-11989	Besides, its that kind of place and what better opportunity to meet people from everywhere than over a table sharing a meal together single or separate checks.
en-unannotated-11990	Came here for dinner, but the restaurant was full.
en-unannotated-11991	If there were a nice park in this area or something this would be forgivable, but there really isn't anywhere nearby to take your food.
en-unannotated-11992	You feel like a Roman emperor.
en-unannotated-11993	As for the breakfast my family expected more variety of food.
en-unannotated-11994	Take this with a grain of salt in that this is the first restaurant that my girlfriend and I ate at in Milan, but this was the best lasagna we've ever had.
en-unannotated-11995	Have lived in NYC for 12 years and I never liked giving reviews.
en-unannotated-11996	Quiet Street, very helpfull Stuff, very friendly!
en-unannotated-11997	Beer was a good price also.
en-unannotated-11998	Smaller quantities force you to savor each bite, which made me enjoy everything just a little bit more.
en-unannotated-11999	Hungry.
en-unannotated-12000	The only thing that was a negative for me was the woman taking the orders.
en-unannotated-12001	Nintendo does it again!
en-unannotated-12002	During the meal I thought I felt my shirt get wet but I thought it was water and I felt the hostess/server wipe my jacket with a towel and assumed she was just drying it.
en-unannotated-12003	Located in one the most sought after locations in Bogota.
en-unannotated-12004	I want people to sit at that table and be sick with longing.
en-unannotated-12005	My husband and I had a wonderful dinner here.
en-unannotated-12006	We came here as soon as they opened since I heard the wait can be pretty long.
en-unannotated-12007	But it took over an hour for the main dishes to be served after we finished the entrees.
en-unannotated-12008	I think it's ranked highly because they have a bunch of stereotypical French dishes on the menu so that one can order a bunch of classics in one meal.
en-unannotated-12009	This was our 4th hotel in 7 nights and the best of them all in terms of all the things that count.
en-unannotated-12010	This was our first stop in Spain and it gave us a wonderful introduction to how kind and friendly the Spanish people are.
en-unannotated-12011	The place was packed!
en-unannotated-12012	The crab salad was perfect, light and flavorful.
en-unannotated-12013	I had the egg white omelette which came with a nice quinoa salad, which I loved.
en-unannotated-12014	So now, 2 stars.
en-unannotated-12015	We had broken glass on the floor of the balcony and having asked house keeping to come and remove they did not bother.
en-unannotated-12016	I'd recommend it...
en-unannotated-12017	I STILL CAN'T LOG IN!!!
en-unannotated-12018	Risotto Osso Buco and linguini con vignole were exquisite.
en-unannotated-12019	The rooms are your average Best Western room size but they have high ceilings.

en-unannotated-12021	The other meat looked yummy as well.
en-unannotated-12022	Delicious and perfect.
en-unannotated-12023	Today I ordered the corn tortillas with pulled pork and sweet potatoes.
en-unannotated-12024	This place is a joke!
en-unannotated-12025	Best pasta I ever ate!!!!!!
en-unannotated-12026	Very nice hotel in a perfect location.
en-unannotated-12027	Lots of good memories!
en-unannotated-12028	The courses were perfectly sized and very well balanced.
en-unannotated-12029	I could make comparisons of the butchers skillfully cutting and caringly preparing the cuts of beef with thoughtful precision, while wearing their aprons with cured meats and sausages hanging in the background and a plethora knifes stuck to the wall, to genuine pizza artisans who can skillfully throw the spinning doe they previously prepared and effortlessly place just the right amount of toppings and sauce well distributed to express how the ordinary could on occasion be extraordinary.
en-unannotated-12030	Holes in the fabric of the furniture.
en-unannotated-12031	2 ordered steak at a seafood restaurant...
en-unannotated-12032	It's a great spot!
en-unannotated-12033	First room given was not up to standard, but it was resolved sufficiently by great staff.
en-unannotated-12034	You get this stamp card, kind of like in US dim sum places for those of you who know what I'm talkin' about, with beer icons that get written/stamped on every time you order a beer.
en-unannotated-12035	Excellent service and atmosphere.
en-unannotated-12036	I have previously been to Jellyfish a number of times in the previous years.
en-unannotated-12037	Very delicious desserts, especially eclair...
en-unannotated-12038	We got the fresh mozzarella and octopus to start, fresh pasta with shrimp and delicious veal for entree, and ended the night with some tiramisu!
en-unannotated-12039	This was a great way to spend an evening in Barcelona.
en-unannotated-12040	I can taste synthetic syrups a mile away and there was none of that nonsense here.
en-unannotated-12041	I walked here from my hotel, Hotel Original in Le Marais.
en-unannotated-12042	I got to Milan starving and I wanted to eat somewhere close and local since I was staying at one of the neighbourhood slightly outside of city centre and I found this one.
en-unannotated-12043	They've created one of the best runner games out there while keeping the Mario and Nintendo spirit alive.
en-unannotated-12044	It was tender and juicy.
en-unannotated-12045	Everything we had there was great: the antipasto appetizer, the homemade spaghetti, the chocolate soufflé, the complimentary Prosecco, complimentary candy and peanuts, the cappuccino, and the wine.
en-unannotated-12046	The rooms were beautiful and clean and the staff was nice.
en-unannotated-12047	My companion and I managed to get a sidewalk table on a warm late-spring evening.
en-unannotated-12048	Service was warm too!
en-unannotated-12049	One year later...
en-unannotated-12050	The gratin was super hot and the cheese was bubbling for so long.
en-unannotated-12051	On a Friday evening we were ten people all and all enjoying Chef [name]'s cooking.
en-unannotated-12052	I never would have discovered Brew without the help of yelp.
en-unannotated-12053	I am in love with Poke, always get it when I am in LA and had it heaps in Hawaii, plus I make it often.
en-unannotated-12054	They were hot and crispy and the grated parmesan on top made them even more tasty.
en-unannotated-12055	Budget: reasonable
en-unannotated-12056	If you're ever tired of shopping in Milan and want one of the best bites of your life, this is the place to go.
en-unannotated-12057	I met a fellow American at a bar and she recommended this spot for dinner, and the next night we went.
en-unannotated-12058	I also had the...
en-unannotated-12059	Would recommend.
en-unannotated-12060	It's a huge time killer, too.
en-unannotated-12061	I had the highest expectations for this meal.
en-unannotated-12062	Not many...
en-unannotated-12063	The bath/shower/sauna in our room as well was amazing, spent most of my time in there!
en-unannotated-12064	Amazing roof top pool & bar.
en-unannotated-12065	The food was typical Russian but the atmosphere and exterior were absolutely brilliant – russian idea of good cheap food in the center of Moscow.
en-unannotated-12066	I love that it's a free app and you don't have to p.t.w. anything.
en-unannotated-12067	Breakfast time starts at 7:00, but they may organize special breakfast for early check out.
en-unannotated-12068	It was VERY central and the area around the hotel was very busy, good busy.
en-unannotated-12069	They all tasted like candy - pickled and vinegar-y ones at that.
en-unannotated-12070	Bar prices very expensive
en-unannotated-12071	It was much easier when I could see them all together.
en-unannotated-12072	The tiramisu was light and fluffy...
en-unannotated-12073	The cafe also sells coffee in bags so you can brew at home.
en-unannotated-12074	And super easy menu - two options to chose from per day (with drink, entree, main course, and small dessert), always...
en-unannotated-12075	The food is incredible.
en-unannotated-12076	Candles galore everywhere, red dripping candle wax.
en-unannotated-12077	The waiter is an amazing Italian guy, who made polite and funny conversations with us.
en-unannotated-12078	Two times in a row.
en-unannotated-12079	Thanks- you made our night.
en-unannotated-12080	All in all, a place to recommend.
en-unannotated-12081	Breakfast was a bit pricey at €25 each
en-unannotated-12082	Potatoes and rosemary: what would you think it would come out of that that you never had??
en-unannotated-12083	A la carte and tasting menu available, good local wine selection, ran with charisma by a young man.
en-unannotated-12084	probably should have anticipated that!
en-unannotated-12085	I go to Mexico City very often and this is my favorite restaurant in town.
en-unannotated-12086	You make your own , I don't know how they actually pulled this off but they did.
en-unannotated-12087	We've stayed here several times when visiting the Dublin area for soccer tournaments.
en-unannotated-12088	Toilet was small.
en-unannotated-12089	really fantastic décor and service, fine wine list.
en-unannotated-12090	Saukraut gnocchi
en-unannotated-12091	The only thing to say about this restaurant is that it is cheap, definitely not Russian, it is just a shopping mall cheap table d'hote.
en-unannotated-12092	Beware- this restaurant is very small so be prepared to wait.
en-unannotated-12093	Fake plastic flowers throughout hotel.
en-unannotated-12094	All round delicious food, and plenty of it - no tiny modern food portions (i.e geometric shapes, smears of sauce and tiny towers).
en-unannotated-12095	My friend and I were sat in the line-up hallway of table after table, where it does get a bit chilly - but being a fan of the cold, I was totally okay with this.
en-unannotated-12096	The food is great too.
en-unannotated-12097	Spam
en-unannotated-12098	Lunch is great too.
en-unannotated-12099	A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to enjoy a very good lunch meal at this restaurant.
en-unannotated-12100	Some of the staff mainly the restaurant
en-unannotated-12101	Cabbage pancake
en-unannotated-12102	What made the goodnight sleep even more amazing was the ceiling were I could see a 16 century painting.
en-unannotated-12103	We sat outside, downstairs, in the bar, and in the dining room.
en-unannotated-12104	I also really love how you're encouraging small artists by hanging up their artworks and selling them.
en-unannotated-12105	This was the second time we have stayed here.
en-unannotated-12106	The apple whatnot (it's like ten syllables long so I can't remember) was superb.
en-unannotated-12107	9 people round a table in front of Xavi's and Nico's kitchen area in a huge, creative, grungy sort of warehouse/loft setting.
en-unannotated-12108	I just can't stop thinking about this meal.
en-unannotated-12109	I don't know if the smell comes from the carpets.
en-unannotated-12110	We really loved the homemade "pina colada" cake - the blend between the rich coconut and...
en-unannotated-12111	Walking in, there was no hostess so we asked the bartender if we just seat ourselves.
en-unannotated-12112	Topped with a portobello and cashel bleu cheese.
en-unannotated-12113	I would have liked some refreshment facilities.
en-unannotated-12114	I couldn´t have guessed further from the truth as this place was half the price of any other place we ate during our stay in Prague with drinks and desserts.
en-unannotated-12115	Dinner here was a great ending to a wonderful trip!
en-unannotated-12116	The gin itself was 7 Euro and the tonic was almost 4.... golly again!
en-unannotated-12117	I have a chance to compare this restaurant with others in Propriano.
en-unannotated-12118	I'm uninstalling.
en-unannotated-12119	WOW, everything about this menu has been well planned and creatively designed.
en-unannotated-12120	We happened upon P Mac's after leaving the Long Hall on a Sunday evening.
en-unannotated-12121	$14 for a burger and fries and they don't include ketchup.
en-unannotated-12122	There's really great seating too - around large tables allowing you to play games (board games are provided). Drinks are well priced too and there's always a good crew there.
en-unannotated-12123	This is a very convenient hotel for the historic centre of Mexico City.
en-unannotated-12124	We were very much looking forward to it.
en-unannotated-12125	Filtered, xpresso, aero-press all kind of coffee making ways and the most important, high quality and so fresh coffee beans.
en-unannotated-12126	Extremely comfy beds and spacious enough rooms.
en-unannotated-12127	Excellent location, helpful staff, good facilities overall.
en-unannotated-12128	Not the best I've had, but they weren't bad.
en-unannotated-12129	I possibly couldn't have explained my illness if he wasn't there.
en-unannotated-12130	After reading the reviews I decided this place is a must try.
en-unannotated-12131	Six people seems to be the best number for this spot.
en-unannotated-12132	It is brand new and very comfortable.
en-unannotated-12133	Stayed there for three night and quite enjoyed it.
en-unannotated-12134	Room are big....
en-unannotated-12135	Myself and my girlfriend stayed here for 3 nights over a weekend.
en-unannotated-12136	Good location , well maintained rooms, good choice in breakfast, very unique interiors.
en-unannotated-12137	It's a new hotel and I think they still have a few things to iron out and polish up.
en-unannotated-12138	I can't get past the Nintendo screen.
en-unannotated-12139	Free parking, 10 minutes away the city center by taxi and 20 min by bus.
en-unannotated-12140	Comfortable bed
en-unannotated-12141	Best​ of all?
en-unannotated-12142	El cardenal is my favorite lunch restaurant for business.
en-unannotated-12143	The rooms are adequately sized and very clean.
en-unannotated-12144	Tried reinstalling but no fix.
en-unannotated-12145	requested housekeeping/room cleaned after two nights..
en-unannotated-12146	I never met a beef tartare I didn't like :)
en-unannotated-12147	Fix the camera in androids.
en-unannotated-12148	We pick a seat and grab our own menus.
en-unannotated-12149	You would not know it was gluten free.
en-unannotated-12150	It was very quiet at night.
en-unannotated-12151	Well today I was in Dresden and had a great German beer, this place serves beer that rivals Germany, Belgium or HOLLAND.
en-unannotated-12152	you can here the voice of the people who are in the other rooms like they are sitting in your room.
en-unannotated-12153	I order a pizza that was served frozen.
en-unannotated-12154	Even though hotel is still being converted hotel was not noisy and staff were very helpful and friendly.
en-unannotated-12155	We showed up on a Thursday without a reservation and they were all booked.
en-unannotated-12156	Sadly the food wasn't as good as we expected.
en-unannotated-12157	well..
en-unannotated-12158	Our GPS took us up some back road that narrowed down to the size of one car.
en-unannotated-12159	breakfast was included....
en-unannotated-12160	We got the Mixed Sausage plate and the Goulash with Dumplings.
en-unannotated-12161	For all of us non-French speakers, they conveniently have a chalkboard with their menu drawn out for us (see pic). For starters, we tried their creamed spinach soup with a soft boiled egg and OMG, it was mike drop amazing!
en-unannotated-12162	I was super happy leaving this place.
en-unannotated-12163	Don't know if that's why my experience was so poor.
en-unannotated-12164	If you really want to go for the pan seared foie gras, I suggest calling the restaurant ahead of time and ask whether they have it for the day.
en-unannotated-12165	Whatever you do, though, don't give up on Le Potager de Pere Thierry!
en-unannotated-12166	An hour passed and our table was forgotten.
en-unannotated-12167	Would be nice if while playing the game you were awarded coins or something based on length achieved to spend to unlock skins.
en-unannotated-12168	The hotel is located in the historic center of Madrid, next to Plaza Santa Ana.
en-unannotated-12169	Fine dining option in old town, which otherwise abounds with tapas bars.
en-unannotated-12170	The stay didn't start out well as they claimed a computer hitch couldn't check me in.
en-unannotated-12171	I would also recommend the pancake stack with lime and mascarpone cheese- it was basically a key lime pie pancake:)) Being from Florida, it was a special treat to find key lime pie flavors out in Europe.
en-unannotated-12172	Perfect location arrived via train,short walk to Apartosuites,easy check in,suite was as we remembered from last year,wow and wow again,very large,clean and with a something special view.
en-unannotated-12173	Even the house wine labels were emblazoned with face of Mussolini and some Nazi soldier doing the salute.
en-unannotated-12174	Check in and check out were flawless and room service was timely.
en-unannotated-12175	I get it!!
en-unannotated-12176	Had the 7 course set.
en-unannotated-12177	My friend got the Gratin of Donegal smoked haddock, spinach, potato, poached eggs, chives & crispy parmesan dish, which was just as delicious.
en-unannotated-12178	With all the great reviews of this place i decided to check it out while in paris but was unfortunately feeling a tad disappointed.
en-unannotated-12179	And you expect good service.
en-unannotated-12180	If you consider yourself a "foodie" this is definitely a MUST.
en-unannotated-12181	Our 9 y.o. got the lamb and 12 y.o. got the salmon platter and everyone licked their plates.
en-unannotated-12182	My son had the fish and chips, which he said were the best he has ever had.
en-unannotated-12183	The cappuccino mousse was also absolutely delightful, light and somehow creamy at the same time, and it was topped with fresh whipped cream.
en-unannotated-12184	we came there, one night after too many McDonald's meals, because we wanted something else.
en-unannotated-12185	Now I'm already a fan before we even got our food.
en-unannotated-12186	So good!
en-unannotated-12187	I don't normally seek out pancakes on a trip to Europe, however these looked so different from the pancakes I normally have in the US that I had to try them.
en-unannotated-12188	we walked to most attractions.
en-unannotated-12189	Located on the port, it has a quick service and friendly staff.
en-unannotated-12190	Again, the presentation was great.
en-unannotated-12191	And also the small cakes and desserts are awesome - but they must do something with the unpleasant service and attitude you get from the waitresses.
en-unannotated-12192	You know why Sake clicked?
en-unannotated-12193	The food was okay if kind of tasteless?
en-unannotated-12194	Come visit lads.
en-unannotated-12195	Got the impression that staff weren't very happy.
en-unannotated-12196	Must try the hazelnuts, Pistachio and chocolate.
en-unannotated-12197	We were greeted warmly with crisp champagne and many incredible courses.
en-unannotated-12198	We sat at an open area close to the bar.
en-unannotated-12199	Also interesting that there were no complementary water in a such expensive room I stayed in - 487euro per night + city tax.
en-unannotated-12200	Steaming hot and delicious!
en-unannotated-12201	Our waiter was Tony, he looked Italian, but I could be wrong.
en-unannotated-12202	Great food and great service.
en-unannotated-12203	It provides parking, correct beds and clean toilets.
en-unannotated-12204	And no, reinstalling, clearing cache or getting a new phone doesn't help.
en-unannotated-12205	There are ample options in each of the courses, especially for non-pork and beef eaters like myself.
en-unannotated-12206	Don't forget to ask for a "vanilla Concha (shell)" it is the best sweet Mexican bread, with coffee or chocolate to enjoy with.
en-unannotated-12207	We made pigs of ourselves on our last nigjt and ordered both the chocolate mousse and creme Brule.
en-unannotated-12208	It was so creamy, and had pumpkin seeds and a dollop of sour cream at the top.
en-unannotated-12209	I only saw the owner and another waitress helped us the entire time so maybe it's only run by two ppl for most of the time?
en-unannotated-12210	Loved it!
en-unannotated-12211	The decor has a vintage feel.
en-unannotated-12212	I definitely recommend a quick spot for some Thai street food if you have that craving near Bastille.
en-unannotated-12213	Xavi and Nico are very friendly and entertaining hosts.
en-unannotated-12214	The carbonara is the best I've ever had in Italy.
en-unannotated-12215	Sake is a modern Japanese restaurant with great cocktails and a fun city vibe.
en-unannotated-12216	I had not had pork belly in a pasta dish before and was interested to see the lack of the crispy skin allowing the taster to fully enjoy the texture and flavours of the pork.
en-unannotated-12217	Its located in a northeast area away, not incredibly far from the Old Town square, but its still a bit hidden away in a local district and neighborhood.
en-unannotated-12218	Have loved it all the way through it's journey so far and am confidant that I will continue to do so.
en-unannotated-12219	It sticks too, so levels that you have to hit small things or run through fast moving objects, it makes you lose.
en-unannotated-12220	They give you plenty...
en-unannotated-12221	I haven't experienced such appalling service in a very long time.
en-unannotated-12222	Clothes dryer did not work (kept alarming when used), kettle was broken and we had a frightening experience when the door's lock failed and we were locked into the apartment for 2 hours, before Simone came to rescue us.
en-unannotated-12223	I'm not sure if it was a band who played together or if people just came in with their instruments and started playing but they were very talented and engaging and made sure that everyone was participating in singing and clapping during their songs.
en-unannotated-12224	It's all great.
en-unannotated-12225	You can choose either meat or seafood with the tasting menu and you get three courses plus dessert for just €28!
en-unannotated-12226	We found this through Trip Advisor & couldn't have been happier.
en-unannotated-12227	My wife and I found this gem near our hotel.
en-unannotated-12228	My husband had savoury mince which was huge, served in a paella pan, heaps but f savoury mince, potato and egg with thick toast.
en-unannotated-12229	For lunch I got a goat cheese salad and fish of the day, which was salmon.
en-unannotated-12230	I'm too much of a wimp for shots so went for the cocktail in a coconut.
en-unannotated-12231	We walked everywhere
en-unannotated-12232	Hailo app was better.
en-unannotated-12233	Chef accomodated alternative eating preferences (vegetarian).
en-unannotated-12234	Looking over the Eagle Street Pier dining precinct in a slightly secluded location next to the Bavarian Bier Cafe, Saké offers a modern insight to the wonderful world of Japanese cuisine.
en-unannotated-12235	We very much enjoyed our stay at the DoubleTree - Parque 93. So much so that we have already planned a return trip to stay at this property and to see more of the city.
en-unannotated-12236	I arrived in bogota Columbia and was relieved to be at the bogota Plaza summit hotel!
en-unannotated-12237	of gummy candies -- of at least three flavors!
en-unannotated-12238	We really wanted to eat a good meal in Paris.
en-unannotated-12239	The presentation of the food is artful without skimping on portions - both times we were too full for dessert (which we both really wish we'd tried). Overall, I would definitely place Fraiche in my "absolute favorite restaurants of all time" list.
en-unannotated-12240	The server was explaining the menu to another English speaker, so I listened in.
en-unannotated-12241	The prices were very fair and the service was perfect.
en-unannotated-12242	I just left this restaurant and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.
en-unannotated-12243	Crispy on the outside and fish-mush on the inside.
en-unannotated-12244	All hail goulash!!
en-unannotated-12245	Though it is a little off the beaten track, there is still lots of transportation that you can take to get here; there's a metro stop just five minutes away.
en-unannotated-12246	Do you want a quick, cheap and casual meal thats totally authentic Mexican and amazingly delicious...
en-unannotated-12247	Love it !!!!!
en-unannotated-12248	Wandering down the staircase from street level to Verve transforms the bustling modem city scape into what feels like a hidden underground club.
en-unannotated-12249	I counted the customers - 16 including us, and many of them were only ordering coffees.
en-unannotated-12250	So much for privacy.
en-unannotated-12251	It had a nice amount of beef inside with a tasty mushroom cream sauce.
en-unannotated-12252	Overall: 4.5/5. Check it out if you find yourself around the Pantheon or the Luxembourg gardens.
en-unannotated-12253	Luckily, we were the first ones there so no wait!
en-unannotated-12254	Thought it was fairly priced compared to restaurants in Paris.
en-unannotated-12255	You have to order it!
en-unannotated-12256	They even had little $3 pots of beer and cider so you could sample your way through the menu while staying classy.
en-unannotated-12257	For our drinks, we got a glass of red and a glass of white wine and for appetizers we went with potato soup with mushrooms (to share). For our main course, I got the confit of duck leg with red cabbage and potato dumplings and my wife got the fried pork schnitzel with mashed potatoes and cucumber salad with dill and sour cream.
en-unannotated-12258	My partner in food crime today had 'the best pizza' she's ever had, with the chicken pizza with marinated fetta, roast capsicum, caramelised onion, thyme and parmesan.
en-unannotated-12259	When we informed the hostess/waitress, she admitted to spilling liquid on my clothing and made a crappy attempt to wipe the jacket with a half damp towel, then said "I don't know what to do" and walked inside.
en-unannotated-12260	Stayed here with a friend for a few nights.
en-unannotated-12261	I still dream about this soup to this day.
en-unannotated-12262	Location wonderful
en-unannotated-12263	Worst app I ever installed never works black screen the whole time and when I do get picture it's advertising 1 after the other  don't know how they would allow an app with so many faults 9n play store, why don't tv3 get there act together and fix it?
en-unannotated-12264	Big slices of pizza, many different option!
en-unannotated-12265	We went for some late afternoon chilling (post walk in the park) with some delicious cocktails and yummy light snacks and left with smiles on our faces.
en-unannotated-12266	Great breakfast.
en-unannotated-12267	I've been to the one in Brno, Czech Republic and the Prague location compares a little differently to the one in Brno.
en-unannotated-12268	BREW also turns into a cool bar at night with a solid selection of craft beverages.
en-unannotated-12269	Poor making of bed.
en-unannotated-12270	There were some noise coming from outside the room, but hey, Rome is a lively city.
en-unannotated-12271	Great menu, great food, prepared with a certain sophisticated simplicity The small, but warm dinning room delivers almost perfect ambiance.
en-unannotated-12272	What's not to like.
en-unannotated-12273	The entree was good, but the main course was tasteless.
en-unannotated-12274	Duck breast (honey and raspberry sauce) - amazing
en-unannotated-12275	We liked it a lot.
en-unannotated-12276	We visited on low season.
en-unannotated-12277	I love that you can create your own burger and that they all come with beer battered fries.
en-unannotated-12278	Delicious.
en-unannotated-12279	I should have trusted my gut and encouraged my group to walk out after the initial encounter with staff upon arrival.
en-unannotated-12280	For my starter, I had a dish with poached egg and parmesan cheese, which was ridiculously good.
en-unannotated-12281	The location is great, near bars and restaurant.
en-unannotated-12282	diferent types of eggs, with chilaquiles, hot chocolate, sweet fresh baked bread.
en-unannotated-12283	Noise from the woody floor and people on the street.
en-unannotated-12284	The room was very adequate, and comfortable.
en-unannotated-12285	Poor form smelly dish, poor form.
en-unannotated-12286	I live in San Francisco and love trying a broad range of restaurants.
en-unannotated-12287	The wifi worked.
en-unannotated-12288	This is not for cheap eats, this is high end and the food and service matches, we had hot chocolate, the best, I repeat, the best you will taste, a sandwich with boiled egg, salmon gravlax, this was huge, 2 people size, beware, Mont Blanc...
en-unannotated-12289	The bar service was below standard for this type of hotel and overall the hotel felt a little tired.
en-unannotated-12290	We finished our meal with the chocolate moose, which was quite nice.
en-unannotated-12291	This is such a cute place.
en-unannotated-12292	Worst app ever funny how the ads work but the main show didn't get the act together poxy app
en-unannotated-12293	Good food and fast service.
en-unannotated-12294	As a "side" we actually ordered, the patatas bravas ($16) with thinly sliced crispy chorizo salamis, was probably the best patatas bravas we've had in Brisbane!
en-unannotated-12295	Go and try it.
en-unannotated-12296	If you want to dine with a great view, Blackbird is your place.
en-unannotated-12297	Great food, varied menu and lovely atmosphere.
en-unannotated-12298	you can't go wrong with a visit!
en-unannotated-12299	We were there for the Christmas menu and had the pork belly starter, the goats cheese starter, the hake and the lamb shank.
en-unannotated-12300	We also enjoyed the Metropolitan Fitness Center
en-unannotated-12301	My reccos:
en-unannotated-12302	Eloisa in the spa was the friendliest person I met in all of Mexico.
en-unannotated-12303	Staff were totally disinterested
en-unannotated-12304	I have very high standards and can be hard to please...
en-unannotated-12305	My fellow luncher was a Miel Container regular so knew she wanted one of the classic Miso Smoked Pork Belly burgers ($13.50) with extra onion rings ($2). Me, being a first-timer and incredibly indecisive, went inside to stare at the menu for a while.
en-unannotated-12306	We booked a table 2 days in advance just to make sure we get in this time.
en-unannotated-12307	The chipotle sauce definitely gave a hot punch to the roast chicken.
en-unannotated-12308	Who was always attentive and helpful.
en-unannotated-12309	The Guinness Stew and the Bacon & Cabbage are very good - solid comfort food in good portions.
en-unannotated-12310	I love it!
en-unannotated-12311	I'm still dreaming about the Baked shell pasta, crispy pancetta, grilled endive, bakes eggs with herbal crumble dish.
en-unannotated-12312	Unfortunately, we didn't love it.
en-unannotated-12313	The staff are immensely accommodating and really make you feel welcome.
en-unannotated-12314	I would go there again if the time comes.
en-unannotated-12315	Usually, once you sit down, the table is yours for at least a few hours or the entire night.
en-unannotated-12316	The prices are very high.
en-unannotated-12317	On the evening we arrived, it seemed like most people here were tourists.
en-unannotated-12318	We found that for regular preparation food and quantity , the price was way too high.
en-unannotated-12319	That's unusual.
en-unannotated-12320	My wife had the seafood chowder, its more like soup, very homemade style, simple but she killed it.
en-unannotated-12321	And pasta with octopus as a main course.
en-unannotated-12322	I loved the place.
en-unannotated-12323	Location is unbeatable..
en-unannotated-12324	- Initially got our *paying* order refused with the waiter saying he "would prefer keeping their champagne for different kind of guests, for you only prosecco";
en-unannotated-12325	When I was a child I must admit I was probably given most of these as christmas presents and thought at the time that they should have been called bored games.
en-unannotated-12326	It's definitely not the place to go if you're looking for something really healthy.
en-unannotated-12327	The...
en-unannotated-12328	I would give 5, as it is a great app....
en-unannotated-12329	While I waited for a seat, I just got a Pilsner (or remember it was two) and started drinking it as I watch for customers to leave.
en-unannotated-12330	Everyone walked away quite happy that night!
en-unannotated-12331	Night trip: I just had to see if the cocktails matched the goodness of the coffee, and it did.
en-unannotated-12332	I'm looking at them more as a friend than stuff.
en-unannotated-12333	Birthdayvisiti!
en-unannotated-12334	The hotdogs were some of the best I've ever had, the pineapple sauce is delicious, and perfect...
en-unannotated-12335	We were in a group and one of our colleagues had the wallet stolen in the restaurant during our breakfast.
en-unannotated-12336	Minimal time for waiting - just about 1 minute.
en-unannotated-12337	[name] checked us out in a smooth and speedy matter and made sure a taxi came on time to take us to the airport.
en-unannotated-12338	They were filling and the ingredients were all fresh.
en-unannotated-12339	I ordered the lamb ribs and hands down the best lamb I ever had.
en-unannotated-12340	Not usually a fan of this dish.
en-unannotated-12341	same for bathroom , except that it functions !
en-unannotated-12342	Breakfast ok in a nice space overlooking the Main Plaza (Zocalo). You can get much better hotels in much better neighborhoods.
en-unannotated-12343	This 600 year old truly authentic Czech pub has done something right.
en-unannotated-12344	I especially enjoyed my ginger tea, with real ginger and honey to season.
en-unannotated-12345	Our server was extremely nice and well mannered.
en-unannotated-12346	Based on previous reviews we decided to check this place out.
en-unannotated-12347	He took the time to explain everything to us.
en-unannotated-12348	No.
en-unannotated-12349	But I'll never come back.
en-unannotated-12350	Tips for (young) players: Bookings are recommended.
en-unannotated-12351	Service was great, food even better.
en-unannotated-12352	It is a very small area, so I highly recommend reservations or coming right when they open.
en-unannotated-12353	Also, very friendly owner amd son.
en-unannotated-12354	Each grain of risotto with just the right amount of chew, and it's all just so rich and delicious.
en-unannotated-12355	My bf is a huge fan of prosciutto and he loved every bite
en-unannotated-12356	The desserts ( we tried three) are to die for.
en-unannotated-12357	Designed by Yabu Pushelberg who are world renowned.
en-unannotated-12358	The coffee was also so phenomenal that we got a second cup to go before leaving.
en-unannotated-12359	It's a lovely, new, modern restaurant.
en-unannotated-12360	Service is always great and like many French restaurants, there's very little interactions with guests unless you call for it.
en-unannotated-12361	Hard to find a better value for money in Rome, will definitely return
en-unannotated-12362	Black Bird Bar & Grill is a relatively new addition to the Riverside Precinct and there's been a lot of hype surrounding it.
en-unannotated-12363	The tartare tasted very fresh and flavorful.
en-unannotated-12364	The food and service was fabulous and I throughly enjoyed what seemed a true Spanish experience with Decor similar to...
en-unannotated-12365	English speaking and great "serve yourself" beer.
en-unannotated-12366	Well you always say it's a temporary problem but, it's been months.
en-unannotated-12367	Also I've had better creme brûlée, I was disappointed.
en-unannotated-12368	Amazing milanese food, cute ambiance, a must try for both tourists and locals.
en-unannotated-12369	A perfectly prepared.
en-unannotated-12370	Our young waiter was not only short with us when asked questions (his English was quite good) but he seemed to have a very bad attitude.
en-unannotated-12371	The muscles, patatas and calamares were nice, although for me it would've been better if the sauce was next to the meal, because it was a little much for me.
en-unannotated-12372	The room is basic with no table cover, but linen napkins.
en-unannotated-12373	We enjoyed breakfast and lunch at different times and recommend both.
en-unannotated-12374	I have never felt so in love with a cafe/ restaurant/bar in a while and I definitely was getting flash backs to my trips to Melbourne.
en-unannotated-12375	The other problem was that we sat inside as it was cold that day and the waiter did not provide us with all the food offerings.
en-unannotated-12376	If the reader.
en-unannotated-12377	Definitely recommend if in the area!
en-unannotated-12378	Had the fettuccine with sausage, mushrooms and truffle cream sauce.
en-unannotated-12379	It was funny lol!
en-unannotated-12380	EVER.
en-unannotated-12381	This place is so rediculously good I almost don't want to tell anyone about it.
en-unannotated-12382	I would not come back here.
en-unannotated-12383	My last day in Paris, I decided to wander the city.
en-unannotated-12384	The steak was equally well cooked.
en-unannotated-12385	Came here based off raving reviews on Yelp when we were in the nearby neighborhood visiting in Paris.
en-unannotated-12386	This is a wonderful gourmet restaurants found in the narrow and winding streets of Ajaccio.
en-unannotated-12387	Each staff member was truly excellent and willing to serve.
en-unannotated-12388	Great food and service in Port Olympic.
en-unannotated-12389	The place was super busy, but generous and welcoming.
en-unannotated-12390	Even the food menu follows the theme with its folded square design, mimicking origami.
en-unannotated-12391	This place is a short 5-minutes walk from Puerta del Sol, a lot of nice places to visit between walking distance or via metro (the Sol station is right there at Puerta del Sol).
en-unannotated-12392	Worth noting that the escargot were amazing.
en-unannotated-12393	I was very amused by how blue it made my mouth!
en-unannotated-12394	Friendly staff!
en-unannotated-12395	3.5.
en-unannotated-12396	I decided to try the buttermilk chicken burger with tomamto on a brioche bun and my god it didn't dissapoint.
en-unannotated-12397	Risotto - with sausage, pistachios and spinach...
en-unannotated-12398	The location is good but that is it.
en-unannotated-12399	The veal Milanese was also very tasty!
en-unannotated-12400	Food was excellent !
en-unannotated-12401	Waiters were nice and attentive!
en-unannotated-12402	Was searching Yelp for a place with authentic Czech food and initially came across this place's sister spot a few blocks away.
en-unannotated-12403	They are always so friendly, helpful and attentive.
en-unannotated-12404	beautiful, confortable and clean rooms.
en-unannotated-12405	Great Hotel, always stay there when in Bogotá. The staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful.
en-unannotated-12406	Roasted duck with balsamic sauce and mashed potato (€17.00)
en-unannotated-12407	The invoice was then not handed out and the credit card was charged.
en-unannotated-12408	a taxi man name Benjamin Novoa, nice person and very kind.
en-unannotated-12409	Plenty of wine to choose from and the table service was second to none.
en-unannotated-12410	Carry a good pair of walking boots if you intend to get about much.
en-unannotated-12411	Loved it, 5* absolutely.
en-unannotated-12412	A bit unfortunate that they were remodelling the lobby at the time we stayed.
en-unannotated-12413	Excellent pastries and customer service.
en-unannotated-12414	They are quite pretty and great for pictures.
en-unannotated-12415	The food was TO DIE FOR!
en-unannotated-12416	The staff were great...
en-unannotated-12417	I have the prosciutto e melone then the spaghetti w/frutti di mare nearly every visit and I have never been disappointed.
en-unannotated-12418	We got our food very slowly, mostly because there were only 2 people working in the care.
en-unannotated-12419	I have stayed here 10+ times in 2 years.
en-unannotated-12420	This is a perfect restaurant for a special night!
en-unannotated-12421	Amazing restaurant managed by the most amazing people.
en-unannotated-12422	Walking distance to Parque 93 and Centro Andino.
en-unannotated-12423	We spoke little Italian but they either spoke Italian or found some to explain.
en-unannotated-12424	This beautiful hotel is perfectly situated in the heart of Madrid's prime shopping district.
en-unannotated-12425	Non-pretentious food that remains artful and creative but more than anything else, divinely delicious.
en-unannotated-12426	The sheppard's pie was very traditional but with a touch too much cheese.
en-unannotated-12427	Right in the middle of La Concha beach overlooking the Bay of Biscay.
en-unannotated-12428	Stacking paper in a 800 year old pub.
en-unannotated-12429	For dinner I had the Osso buco with saffron risotto, incredible.
en-unannotated-12430	A few honourable mentions according to my friends?
en-unannotated-12431	Dusty chandelier.
en-unannotated-12432	Is more like if u just want to be talking and taking a fee drinks with your friends
en-unannotated-12433	During the...
en-unannotated-12434	Great app for searching nearly everything you could want.
en-unannotated-12435	I was in heaven.
en-unannotated-12436	Seriously?
en-unannotated-12437	check in on arrival was not very friendly and we have waited till 45 past 3pm for our bedroom.
en-unannotated-12438	the room was a nightmare the bed was dirty and not comfortable.
en-unannotated-12439	This can be enough for 2 people, or 1 really hungry tourist who's been walking all day.
en-unannotated-12440	We booked online and had to wait 90 days, however if you are flexible you might be able to get a table when you get yourself on...
en-unannotated-12441	I not often you get to dine in places that are truly quality focused, no bs, no gimmicks and yet by there very nature theatrical and extroverted.
en-unannotated-12442	Place: 4.5
en-unannotated-12443	Loly is welcoming & a perfect host and her food is incredible.
en-unannotated-12444	Share 3 plates with a friend I suppose.
en-unannotated-12445	3. Cod with a light parmesan mousse with sausage.
en-unannotated-12446	The roast chicken spatchcock with chipotle was equally delicious.
en-unannotated-12447	Both were absolutely delicious.
en-unannotated-12448	Only a short walk from our holiday apartment in Gracia, this restaurant is outstanding.
en-unannotated-12449	This is an elegant and beautiful hotel in the centre of the city that is full of history.
en-unannotated-12450	After reading the other two reviews, I guess I made the right decision in heading to the Survey Co for dinner (instead of lunch - though that pulled pork baguette is still calling to me).
en-unannotated-12451	channels are not clear.
en-unannotated-12452	We chose to book this hotel because of its view of the Royal Palace, which is lit at night until midnight.
en-unannotated-12453	5 stars!
en-unannotated-12454	FAAANNNCCEEEEE!
en-unannotated-12455	LOBBY AND GENERAL AREAS:
en-unannotated-12456	The hotel is extremely nice with big spacious rooms and very clean.
en-unannotated-12457	With strong good coffee and tasty breakfast .
en-unannotated-12458	Also had a cream puff like dessert which was very good.
en-unannotated-12459	I don't even know where to begin.
en-unannotated-12460	We settled on a...
en-unannotated-12461	I would've came here more if I found it earlier in my trip.
en-unannotated-12462	It paired extremely well with the wine.
en-unannotated-12463	The Marlin is amazing.
en-unannotated-12464	Our first meal in Italy, which we thought was good, but as our trip came to and end, we quickly realized that this was our least favorite meal.
en-unannotated-12465	I also had the best whiskey sour I've ever had here- so many freshly squeezed lemons and limes.
en-unannotated-12466	Really great small cafe, and the pancakes are just as good as advertised.
en-unannotated-12467	Although we were quite full by that point, we were impressed enough with the dishes that we also decided to order a dessert.
en-unannotated-12468	Guess he was there filming a movie.
en-unannotated-12469	The Survey Co has everything you are looking for in a fine dining experience.
en-unannotated-12470	Fantastic restaurant!
en-unannotated-12471	Mad props for that streak.
en-unannotated-12472	I hate i had to use fb it had to have all my fb pictures my i did not get to create an account i dont want me kids pic on my tinder i also wasnt going to share with friends i had an account even if they dont post they should have a 2nd option not to use fb.
en-unannotated-12473	Highly, highly recommended.
en-unannotated-12474	The bartender/waitress is very helpful in picking out which beers we want, also lets us sample.
en-unannotated-12475	The pizza was very oily and nothing special.
en-unannotated-12476	It was a quaint restaurant with few tables, decorations (refrigerator, typewriters, clocks, clothe lines etc) that brought me back to my grandma's time.
en-unannotated-12477	When it comes to the entree the fish was under cooked, the breading was soggy and did not stick to the fish at all and there was a general lack of seasonings/flavor.
en-unannotated-12478	We went early on a...
en-unannotated-12479	We started with the antipasti which of course had Prosciutto, Buffalo Mozzarella, Salami and various Vegs.
en-unannotated-12480	A cheese lover at heart, there is no complaint to the quantity or the flavours it added but some rethought into the presentation of the dish would made it more visual appealing.
en-unannotated-12481	Sadly, we skipped the beer altogether since everything else on tap was the same-old-same-old Pilsner Urquell, etc.
en-unannotated-12482	Friendly service.
en-unannotated-12483	I should have known better, seeing as how close it was to the duomo.
en-unannotated-12484	Then I had the Baked Fillet of Cod which was decent, but I wish they put the sauce on the fish to give it more flavor rather than a little on the side.
en-unannotated-12485	It was basically baked cheese on a crustini with all sorts of garnish.
en-unannotated-12486	A wonderful place for you to find off the main strip- we will be back!
en-unannotated-12487	Normally they tell you to avoid anything on the square but this is one exception!
en-unannotated-12488	The bartender?
en-unannotated-12489	It was so heavy, I couldn't finish my dish.
en-unannotated-12490	I would definitely recommend making a reservation; we just happened to get lucky that there was an available table for us, but a few couples that came in...
en-unannotated-12491	My seared foie gras was drizzled by a reduction of some sort (balsamic?
en-unannotated-12492	[ October 2015 ]
en-unannotated-12493	I'm looking forward to next time.
en-unannotated-12494	If you've never tried a boxty and are in the Temple Bar area, you need to go here!
en-unannotated-12495	The hotel is in a residential area so it's quiet and feels safe.
en-unannotated-12496	All burgers are cooked to medium unless otherwise specified.
en-unannotated-12497	But why I can't do that anymore?
en-unannotated-12498	It's a basic cafeteria line, and you can get just about whatever you want in...
en-unannotated-12499	we booked for next day and were lucky,restaurant was really full but...
en-unannotated-12500	I expected both to be top level, ambience and food.
en-unannotated-12501	I like this game a lot.
en-unannotated-12502	Pastries look & taste marvelous - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - after your visit to Centre Pompidou then go see Fontaine Stravinsky situated behind fountain is Église Saint-Merri church - right across from the church front door is Monsieur Benjamin Art of Pastry shop!!
en-unannotated-12503	Then we said that's ok how about the theatre , operah..
en-unannotated-12504	aaa food, service and good prices in a very nice surroundings the mexican food is a must in this restaurant
en-unannotated-12505	A reminder, french service is very different from American.
en-unannotated-12506	Shows error when trying to watch programme..
en-unannotated-12507	excellent quality chicken served with surprising delicious sauces
en-unannotated-12508	My girlfriend and I wanted to go somewhere nice for our last night in Dublin, and boy did we choose well.
en-unannotated-12509	Quiet place so you are able to talk and walking distance from the marriott hotel in reforma.
en-unannotated-12510	Don't have much knowledge about the authenticity of this restaurant but I had a great meal!
en-unannotated-12511	We stayed here a couple of days ago.
en-unannotated-12512	The neighbors stuck a note on our door threatening to call the police because of noise we weren't excessively noisy at all.
en-unannotated-12513	Closer to the bar are some high tables with stools.
en-unannotated-12514	I constantly have to change my work info.
en-unannotated-12515	The hotel itself is situated on a very busy street and a few of the nights the traffic noise (and the honking horns) woke me up .
en-unannotated-12516	Desert: Panna Cotta.
en-unannotated-12517	More than enough for 4 people, but we were being pigs, so whatever, ha.
en-unannotated-12518	Worth the visit.
en-unannotated-12519	As a New Yorker, I found the prices almost laughably low, and I might just have to move to this country.
en-unannotated-12520	Highly recommend!
en-unannotated-12521	But when you add some beer into the mix it can be a very relaxing way to kill a few hours here at P Mac's and reminisce over the thought that your parents were actually cooler than you gave them credit for at the time!
en-unannotated-12522	Gone is the glorious multi-coloured seaweed salad and even though we had 8 dishes none of then were anywhere near as good as before.
en-unannotated-12523	We visited this restaurant twice during our visit to Propriano and deliberately went back the second time due to the great food and service the first time.
en-unannotated-12524	It's served buffet at cafe urbano.
en-unannotated-12525	It was after lunch around 2pm so plenty of tables available.
en-unannotated-12526	The food was amazing!
en-unannotated-12527	This was one of our highlights and I can whole-heartedly recommend this to every person visiting this glorious city!
en-unannotated-12528	The prices are also pretty good - we got two tall drinks for under $10.
en-unannotated-12529	It is modern, well appointed and comfortable.
en-unannotated-12530	It is also...
en-unannotated-12531	This was the best steak tartare that I've ever had-- seasoned so well that I felt like I was eating a cooked burger.
en-unannotated-12532	I found it thanks to the high ratings on Yelp and came here for one of my last meals with my mom before she left the country.
en-unannotated-12533	I loved the potato quesedillas...
en-unannotated-12534	We had to wait quite a while before the rest of the guests arrived.
en-unannotated-12535	Rooms towards the courtyard are quiter.
en-unannotated-12536	Room was basic but bed very comfy & coffee and smiles at 6am the next morning so appreciated.
en-unannotated-12537	There coffees are fantastic added to their Toast with tomato and oil wow.
en-unannotated-12538	Try the Pulled Pork sandwich with the Yucca root fries.
en-unannotated-12539	I visited this place based on good reviews on trip adviser.
en-unannotated-12540	The best food was - surprisingly - the chips.
en-unannotated-12541	As you walk along the boardwalk overlooking Brisbane River, it's hard to resist stopping by Jellyfish, whether for drinks or an intimate dinner for two.
en-unannotated-12542	The decoration is amazing, I felt very comfortable in my room and the personnel is polite and they are willing to help you all the time.
en-unannotated-12543	The hotel is old, the badroom smell cigarrete even though we asked for a nom smooking room, the ar conditioner dosent work very well and the bathroom have stinks a little but
en-unannotated-12544	Food was delivered to us within fifteen minutes which is pretty impressive given the number of people there and the small kitchen.
en-unannotated-12545	What followed was a parade of wonderful, innovative dishes individually introduced to us by either the waiter or the chef.
en-unannotated-12546	The cafe is small and the tables are little more than shelves for your coffee next to bar stolls but John Mills is the real deal.
en-unannotated-12547	Came here for dinner one night and it was packed!
en-unannotated-12548	Get the platter which is a good value of money.
en-unannotated-12549	The owners are nice and the view to the port is also great, hardly find...
en-unannotated-12550	I was not disappointed in the least.
en-unannotated-12551	A fabulous breakfast buffet.
en-unannotated-12552	We were lucky to get a nice seat inside though it can get pretty busy and I can see there being a bit of a wait to go in depending on what time you go.
en-unannotated-12553	Very good restaurant.
en-unannotated-12554	The portion is pretty large but I had no trouble cleaning my plate.
en-unannotated-12555	*****4.5 stars*****
en-unannotated-12556	Not only are there Monastry beer will blow your mind, but the best crispy duck I've had un Praha!
en-unannotated-12557	When going to highly rated/recommended restaurants, I am happy to...
en-unannotated-12558	Among many other touristic places along the promenade, this small and cosy restaurant offers typical cuisine, mainly fish dishes, carefully cooked using fresh ingredients.
en-unannotated-12559	It's on a tiny narrow side alley across from a brightly lit pizzeria.
en-unannotated-12560	Very clean and modern hotel in a trendy area close to restaurants, bars .
en-unannotated-12561	The lovely pool was an added bonus.
en-unannotated-12562	Initially we went to their main location on Kozlov but it was jam packed so we walked 10 mins over to this location..
en-unannotated-12563	Portion sizes are big.
en-unannotated-12564	Taken here by a true local, couldn't have found it by ourselves!
en-unannotated-12565	It's new and small and super busy.
en-unannotated-12566	Cooke d medium, sliced, topped with carmelised onions, and served with incredibly addictive chips and a perfect salad.
en-unannotated-12567	Good location.
en-unannotated-12568	). We were really excited to have fish and chips in Dublin but unfortunately the fish and chips here did not meet basic standards or compare to the fish and chips back in the states.
en-unannotated-12569	The hotel is an easy walking distance to  many of the sites people come to Rome to see, including the Pantheon, the Forum Ruins, the Altare della Patria, the National Museum and Campo de Fiori.
en-unannotated-12570	Next morning request for changing room again.
en-unannotated-12571	A must go!
en-unannotated-12572	I felt that ratings and reviews on this hotel are inflated somehow.
en-unannotated-12573	A big dissapointment for a 5 star hotel, you can find  2-3 star hotels around via condotti which are better quality and a has a good location with half price.
en-unannotated-12574	The service is better than anything you are likely to get from older, more established hotels.
en-unannotated-12575	Looking for a breakfast option, my friend and I stumbled upon this place thanks to Yelp.
en-unannotated-12576	The restaurant was so beautiful inside as well!
en-unannotated-12577	Beds and pillows are great, location is perfect
en-unannotated-12578	Like barely edible.
en-unannotated-12579	Also what impressed me is marks in menu on food that was frozen.
en-unannotated-12580	I'm over this game.
en-unannotated-12581	My feast tonight was all about ducks!
en-unannotated-12582	It was like Top Chef live!
en-unannotated-12583	Lack of multi user support is a real downer.
en-unannotated-12584	It is a very small and charming restaurant and we really enjoyed ourselves and the ambiance.
en-unannotated-12585	Recomend highyl!
en-unannotated-12586	Only a couple of places for quick diner around.
en-unannotated-12587	It was never too crowded, the staff (who...
en-unannotated-12588	The presentation of all the dishes were beautiful, too bad the flavors didn't come with the territory.
en-unannotated-12589	I hate SOUNDCLOUDDDDD!!!
en-unannotated-12590	friendly staff.
en-unannotated-12591	They do have seating, but it can be hard to find a seat at peak times.
en-unannotated-12592	You want to be close to the bay.
en-unannotated-12593	We overnighted in San Sebastian on our way from Bordeaux to Madrid.
en-unannotated-12594	So, I went with trying it out at least once.
en-unannotated-12595	Everything we needed was easily reached by foot, and the staff were extremely helpful to direct us to our next fun thing to do.
en-unannotated-12596	I wanted to try this restaurant b/c of the marvelous reviews...
en-unannotated-12597	Great job guys!!
en-unannotated-12598	Make it possible that even when the app is closed the music is still playing.
en-unannotated-12599	Touring the area and stumbled into his place from four square reviews and food was delicious and felt very home and place was quant.
en-unannotated-12600	This meal was "close your eyes" good!!
en-unannotated-12601	Everything was really good and cheap.
en-unannotated-12602	I struggled to finish the pie but it was so good, I didn't want to leave anything on my plate.
en-unannotated-12603	The sauce goes well with it too.
en-unannotated-12604	Really kind.
en-unannotated-12605	This is immediately noticeable from the elaborate furnishings which comprise a mixture of a bar with typical high table and bench seating, restaurant table seating, a handful of sunken group tables with cushion seating and bar-style seating around the kitchen.
en-unannotated-12606	Comfortable room.
en-unannotated-12607	Go there when you are around and enjoy a snack or a drink.
en-unannotated-12608	We asked the woman in front for an English menu which she gave us and told us about the seating area.
en-unannotated-12609	Glad we stopped by.
en-unannotated-12610	Don't get me wrong-it's a great place.
en-unannotated-12611	Great restaurants and night clubs by foot.
en-unannotated-12612	1 chair was broken, but we had enough others.
en-unannotated-12613	Very nice venue, tables not too close together, staff polite and attentive but not pushy.
en-unannotated-12614	And last but not least the drain of the shower in the bathroom was clogged, so we had a little flood in the first morning...
en-unannotated-12615	The service, the setting but...
en-unannotated-12616	Location is the only upside with this hotel.
en-unannotated-12617	Service not very good and somewhat rude.
en-unannotated-12618	Desserts were delish.
en-unannotated-12619	Very kind and professional reception and service.
en-unannotated-12620	Literally steam coming off the plate as the friendly server brought it to me.
en-unannotated-12621	Potatoes in new formats!
en-unannotated-12622	Food was delicious and service was great, enjoyed the ambient as well
en-unannotated-12623	You wont regret it.
en-unannotated-12624	The menu isn't long and they had a tasting menu so I opted for that.
en-unannotated-12625	Perfect!!!
en-unannotated-12626	I loved the fact we had the...
en-unannotated-12627	Italians eat like is going to be the last dinner or the end of the world and we cannot keep that pace.
en-unannotated-12628	This became our bar of choice during our visit to Corte.
en-unannotated-12629	I love that when I miss Red Rock that I can catch up
en-unannotated-12630	It was amazing!
en-unannotated-12631	The space was off the wall with each area having its own feel to it.
en-unannotated-12632	The rhubarb crumble was also very tasty.
en-unannotated-12633	Great sandwich!
en-unannotated-12634	In the US, when we think Best Western, I think a motel or a motor inn type of place.
en-unannotated-12635	:( so we decided to order the duck breast entree and foie gras ravioli.
en-unannotated-12636	Cheese plate was meh.
en-unannotated-12637	Yuri and his serving partner were great.
en-unannotated-12638	Room comfortable large bed.
en-unannotated-12639	Number of tinder software updates this exact same review has been written with no response/solution from tinder for problems: 35
en-unannotated-12640	They are really nice and have a delicious menu, the food was really good.
en-unannotated-12641	I know this is a hostel, I'm a single traveler, so what do I want with a room with 3 beds crammed in.
en-unannotated-12642	Dinner is a little more complex than lunch.
en-unannotated-12643	I love the energetic spirit the waiter had.
en-unannotated-12644	Complementary breakfast was awesome.
en-unannotated-12645	We shared a plate of the fried cheese that comes with tartar sauce and added a side of mashed potatoes.
en-unannotated-12646	We made the reservation a day in advance.
en-unannotated-12647	I was hoping to have a drink outside to get the views but the area was booked out for another event so we did what was suggested.
en-unannotated-12648	This also sets it apart from heaps of coffee shops in the CBD who close on Sundays (why?)
en-unannotated-12649	Looking forward to coming back here in the future!
en-unannotated-12650	My meat dish melted in my mouth and the gravy over my mash was to die for.
en-unannotated-12651	Staff are friendly and sound.
en-unannotated-12652	One of my favorite spots in Prague.
en-unannotated-12653	Highly recommended, ultra smooth, delicious bbq sauce.
en-unannotated-12654	However, I wish we had just stayed downstairs and drunken beers instead.
en-unannotated-12655	And the Luigi bosca malbec was just perfect.
en-unannotated-12656	Unfurtanally this was not a pleasure trip since we went to a funeral but we picked this
en-unannotated-12657	The room is really, really nice, and the atmosphere is very good.
en-unannotated-12658	Being a five star hotel no electric kettle
en-unannotated-12659	i wont rush back.
en-unannotated-12660	Our room was clean and functional.
en-unannotated-12661	For the last 10 years this restaurant is one of the reasons I like visiting Moscow.
en-unannotated-12662	This restaurant may be a little expensive compared to some of the other restaurants you may wander into, but it's not inaccessible.
en-unannotated-12663	I had the vegetarian (18euro) offering and shared a desert (7euro) and a bottle of house red wine(25euro). My fellow diner had the organic cottage pie with cheese (21euro). The whole thing came to 72euro total so a little over the 60euro worth of food/drink that we anticipated we would use.
en-unannotated-12664	The hotel is nice, the rooms are ok, the staff is friendly and the breakfast buffet is quite complete.
en-unannotated-12665	com including other accommodation in Rome.
en-unannotated-12666	Love it, lots of fun and addictive.
en-unannotated-12667	Seemed like a definitive place where locals go to have a casual (very) meal.
en-unannotated-12668	You can see the city from the window and it's just full of atmosphere.
en-unannotated-12669	It was clean and at some point in its history it was top of the line, I expected more for the amount of money I paid.
en-unannotated-12670	The snail starter alone is worth the visit.
en-unannotated-12671	Highly recommended!
en-unannotated-12672	Easy enough, eh?
en-unannotated-12673	Well worth a visit
en-unannotated-12674	The key selling point for Peklo is the atmosphere, which I agree is unique.
en-unannotated-12675	I think its a great game.
en-unannotated-12676	There is often a line at the counter and for good reason.
en-unannotated-12677	It included plenty of closet space, a safe and shelving to store clothing and other items.
en-unannotated-12678	It is not your regular stuff, it is gourmet, original and delicious.
en-unannotated-12679	The service is Czech, be polite and get polite back, be pushy and surly...
en-unannotated-12680	our other friend ordered the 'Salchichas' and was surprised by its simplicity to...
en-unannotated-12681	A combo of the two would render me completely catatonic!
en-unannotated-12682	I had the chicken and pork flautas and they were super tasty.
en-unannotated-12683	But very expensive
en-unannotated-12684	We will stay somewhere else next time.
en-unannotated-12685	For mains, we ordered the: Curry Beef Cheeks, steamed rice, cabbage, fried shallots & peanuts (medium - $30) & the Z'tar dusted spatchcock, buttered leeks, chickpeas, tahini yoghurt (medium - $32)
en-unannotated-12686	Eventually I picked up what I thought was a smaller drinks menu to find it was a brunch menu with more reasonable prices.
en-unannotated-12687	I had the steak boxty, which was cooked perfectly to order (medium rare). Mushroom sauce was delicious.
en-unannotated-12688	If you are just a little peckish you should try the bacon and parmesan cheese fries.
en-unannotated-12689	But half hourly good bus service into resort (1.70 euro one way) on coast road 10 mins walk away.
en-unannotated-12690	But now, 4 weeks later its not working.
en-unannotated-12691	And yes, they do a speedy job of it.
en-unannotated-12692	My boyfriend and I devoured the entire meal.
en-unannotated-12693	I'm trying to try all the mains on the menu, up to now the third steak is my best plate.
en-unannotated-12694	Be forewarned that the website mistakingly says this establishment is open until 0200 but that is incorrect: we made the mistake of coming after midnight one night only to find that the kitchen was already closed.
en-unannotated-12695	Food did not take long to come out and customer service was great.
en-unannotated-12696	You know long it to me to get to 5k toads!?!
en-unannotated-12697	The room is very spacious, comfortable and clean.
en-unannotated-12698	One of my fav pubs in Dublin, chill and cosy, with kind of small rooms on the side (when they are available is sooo perfect!), games....
en-unannotated-12699	In the bathroom there are slippers, hair rollers, an old bath robe etc.
en-unannotated-12700	Nothing to complain, i wish all the best for this place!
en-unannotated-12701	These guys know coffee.
en-unannotated-12702	The hosts were very friendly...
en-unannotated-12703	Not bad at all for a hotel restaurant, in fact way up there with the best in...
en-unannotated-12704	The drainage is not good and cannot adjust the water temperature!
en-unannotated-12705	Serious fangirl, here.
en-unannotated-12706	Highly recommend this venue for quite early drinks with friends and convo, that can easily turn into late night bar fun with the DJ in action!
en-unannotated-12707	Apart from that, though, it's your standard bar drinks and gastropub food i.e. bar standards with some strange modifications.
en-unannotated-12708	You get an option of a Brioche or Ciabatta Bun (or Gluten Free for an extra $2 I think) and can opt for beef (grass fed pattie or rib fillet), grilled lean chicken, crumbed fish, veggie pattie or plain veggies.
en-unannotated-12709	Great hotel and very attentive staff.
en-unannotated-12710	We will definitely be back.
en-unannotated-12711	Stayed here on the start of my Mexico trip and enjoyed the location and the friendly staff.
en-unannotated-12712	I wasn't very hungry, so I selected the beef broth noodle soup, which was hot and nice -- nothing crazy filling thankfully.
en-unannotated-12713	Our first boxty!
en-unannotated-12714	I booked the hotel by "HOTELS.
en-unannotated-12715	Too boring .
en-unannotated-12716	The staff were uniformly delightful.
en-unannotated-12717	We arrived at the hotel around 10 AM and we were going to leave the luggage with the concierge because the checkin was at 3 PM but they accommodated us and gave us room right away.
en-unannotated-12718	I went with a mate last night to have dinner.
en-unannotated-12719	Shower was broken.
en-unannotated-12720	My goodness me.
en-unannotated-12721	My husband and I travel a lot...
en-unannotated-12722	Breakfast is good too.
en-unannotated-12723	We've visited this place 2 times and certainly we will come back next stay in Barcelona.
en-unannotated-12724	It was insane.
en-unannotated-12725	The hotel is modern, the rooms very good, the service very friendly, the integrated Cafeteria a real marvel: Very economic small breakfast choices at small prices, small snacks.
en-unannotated-12726	Love this little site everything I have bought off dd as been within a 20k range and oh so cheap finds if you ready look don't just click and say no ty look at want else they maybe selling you never know what u will find this is my one big jumble sale site 5***** and more
en-unannotated-12727	They put the counterfeit money, which used to burn to the dead in China, in the plate.
en-unannotated-12728	If I could, I would give this place a bonus star due to the experience and the quality of the food.
en-unannotated-12729	Great salads, fairly good pizzas (although a little thin and maybe not as good as other options there), and VERY nice proprietors are a few of the reasons we visited this place several times on our trip.
en-unannotated-12730	omg SOOOO DELICIOUS.
en-unannotated-12731	We were so lucky to get a spot with no reservations.
en-unannotated-12732	My new local?
en-unannotated-12733	But everyone u not win I know u are  uninstall this and want to play this game to install this and play a game  hahahaha But it's ok nyc game this
en-unannotated-12734	This is my "go to hotel" whenever I am in Mexico city.
en-unannotated-12735	Excellent service.
en-unannotated-12736	The owner is a super sweet guy and is always walking around talking to people and the staff is always friendly...
en-unannotated-12737	Quite hot and busy.
en-unannotated-12738	Delicious!
en-unannotated-12739	The grilled squid and pizza are great.
en-unannotated-12740	She opened her home to us, answered all our questions- from housing, travel (she has extensive experiences), international politics, the French views, and she is a food...
en-unannotated-12741	[name], our bell boy was very helpful giving us all the information from the hotel amenities and services to places to visit and close by.
en-unannotated-12742	It was AMAZING.
en-unannotated-12743	The serving looks small from the picture, but both my husband and I were completely stuffed and we didn't eat our eggs.
en-unannotated-12744	Supprisingly nothing was mentioned about that when we booked for 4 days to sight see Madrid.
en-unannotated-12745	Prost!!!!!!
en-unannotated-12746	what do you do???
en-unannotated-12747	Stumbled upon this restaurant I was looking forward to tasting some really fresh delicious Australian fish.
en-unannotated-12748	Helpful and friendly reception; the bed; the bedroom decor; the shared lounge areas; the location near Spanish steps.
en-unannotated-12749	Once inside, there are multiple rooms the lead to each other with oval doors and fireplaces nestled in every corner.
en-unannotated-12750	I had a Mushroom risotto and a duck entrée.
en-unannotated-12751	They still ask me questions but it seems less than the people who choose every ingredient.
en-unannotated-12752	Quiet streets and surrounding area
en-unannotated-12753	The baked potatoes with cheeses and other additives was really delightful as well.
en-unannotated-12754	This was our best meal in Paris!
en-unannotated-12755	Very efficient, friendly.
en-unannotated-12756	but then it was November
en-unannotated-12757	We stayed at this wonderful hotel in a safe and beautiful section of the city.
en-unannotated-12758	Everyone kept posting pictures of the bread bowl and someone I met at the hostel I stayed at recommended to me that I try the pork knuckle so I gave this place a go.
en-unannotated-12759	It really was enjoyed by all.
en-unannotated-12760	Hesperia Madrid is no doubt a 5-star hotel.
en-unannotated-12761	a awesome hotel room/suite.....
en-unannotated-12762	Good wine list as well.
en-unannotated-12763	The fries were served in a funky cup (hello hipster!) and garlic sauce on the side.
en-unannotated-12764	Lunch menu was a great selection at a great price, and our server, Mike, was efficient and gave us some good tips for our stay in Dublin.
en-unannotated-12765	Meat was everywhere.
en-unannotated-12766	A must try.
en-unannotated-12767	Overall, great food, great service, a great time.
en-unannotated-12768	Season ends in 2 days
en-unannotated-12769	Attractive and attentive servers that ensured we had everything we needed.
en-unannotated-12770	One of the best dinners ever.
en-unannotated-12771	No light above the bathroom mirror and no other effective lighting near a mirror (putting on make up under a high spotlight is not ideal!)
en-unannotated-12772	I would recommend going here at least once!
en-unannotated-12773	We had coffee and breakfast.
en-unannotated-12774	So almost perfect..
en-unannotated-12775	Rooms more spacious than your average Roman hotel .
en-unannotated-12776	Staff were extremely helpful and lovely, all spoke English.
en-unannotated-12777	Nice place with minimalistic authentical design.
en-unannotated-12778	In all honesty, I forget what I ended up with but it did come with a cute art design!
en-unannotated-12779	My main was a generous helping of cod over flavorful veggies.
en-unannotated-12780	interestingly enough, I was told to use the nori as a wrap and add the lamb, pickles, radish, and kewpie (Japanese mayonnaise) all together.
en-unannotated-12781	The waiter suggested the Laneway Cones - which consist of chocolate ganache, rasberry puree topped with vanilla ice cream all in a cone.
en-unannotated-12782	We found this place on Yelp.
en-unannotated-12783	Highlights: service, escargot, French onion soup and the beef.
en-unannotated-12784	My wife said some of her escargots were gritty.
en-unannotated-12785	
en-unannotated-12786	God awful service.
en-unannotated-12787	I love the 9 ball addition but there's a glitch that allows everyone to 9 ball break using the first diamond near the top corner pocket and the beginner stick.
en-unannotated-12788	They have artwork on the wall that are fun and interesting..
en-unannotated-12789	For dessert my daughter Chocolate Fondant - it was ridiculously good - I had a Cafe Gourmet - which if you don't know is a small coffee and little servings of some of the dessert selection - mine came with the fondant and an apricot mouse.
en-unannotated-12790	The spatchcock was equally tender, seasoned perfectly, & tahini yoghurt adding a fresh dimension to the dish.
en-unannotated-12791	This elegantly comfortable establishment offers large plush rooms, excellent breakfasts and on site parking.
en-unannotated-12792	2nd course was great.
en-unannotated-12793	We started with Beef Tetaki and Blue Fin Tuna Sashimi (a special on that night). The Tetaki hit the spot and the Blue Fin Tuna was an offering of 3 different cuts starting out least fatty to the most fatty cut.
en-unannotated-12794	Skip.
en-unannotated-12795	Brew was one of the first laneway pioneers in Brisbane CBD, I have watched Brew evolve from a coffee cart down an alley into a full on awesome cafe by day and underground bar by night.
en-unannotated-12796	Then you choose 3 veggies (fresh and grilled options), cheese (tasty/cheddar/gran pardano/brie) plus a sauce from a massive list.
en-unannotated-12797	There was a massive amount of fish, which is not always the case with this kind of dish, and was topped with perfectly cooked poached eggs and wonderful crispy Parmesan cheese.
en-unannotated-12798	I completely LOVED the place and both owners that were so welcoming and nice with us.
en-unannotated-12799	Initially we were going to stay in the Historica La Candelaria district, but upon research we felt it would be more conducive to safety measures to stay in the Zona Rosa area instead.
en-unannotated-12800	If you read the background you'll be impressed with the thought and expertise that was applied to...
en-unannotated-12801	It was cold in Paris, and we had travelled all day.
en-unannotated-12802	We ate here after seeing the reviews on tripadvisor and we weren't dissapointed.
en-unannotated-12803	If you are a guest at the Hilton in Bogota or is just looking for a good and silent place to eat the Ventana is your first choice.
en-unannotated-12804	If you like seafood this will quench your thirst for it.
en-unannotated-12805	We started with the house Chardonnay, which in my opinion was great.
en-unannotated-12806	I highly recommend sharing it among two people, I made the terrible mistake of trying to eat it myself and it was way too much meat!
en-unannotated-12807	We had awesome tacos.
en-unannotated-12808	We have been recommended to this restaurant by our hotel who made the necessary booking.
en-unannotated-12809	Thank you yelpers!
en-unannotated-12810	And the magic tricks this app can do in the form of special searches of all your images is amazing!
en-unannotated-12811	And I don't mind paying for the rest of the game- it doesn't even cost that much anyway if you think about it.
en-unannotated-12812	Returned on this trip and equally enjoyed my dinner.
en-unannotated-12813	Crowded.
en-unannotated-12814	It seems I dont have to say that this decent restaurant is good.
en-unannotated-12815	Including the sweet and beer, the total bill came to...
en-unannotated-12816	Finally, given a room on the higher floor with good sun light.
en-unannotated-12817	We opted for the tasting menu which is a set price and includes 1/2 a bottle of wine each.
en-unannotated-12818	We were with a a party of 8 and nobody was disappointed.
en-unannotated-12819	Safe.
en-unannotated-12820	Well....
en-unannotated-12821	It also helped that their English was very good as well!
en-unannotated-12822	Warning: Play for once and then, there's no looking back!
en-unannotated-12823	I can't say my meal at Lokal was all that special.
en-unannotated-12824	Portions are perfect.
en-unannotated-12825	Ham, cheese, a delicious setting on Place Gaffory in Corte, and a local Petra beer.
en-unannotated-12826	This was a bistro recommended by a friend and boy was it delicious.
en-unannotated-12827	Old and dingy feel
en-unannotated-12828	Deserts were the highlight of evening!
en-unannotated-12829	Pretty flavorless really - the boxty and the dish overall and I'm SO glad we paid half the price of the main menu items.
en-unannotated-12830	If you have the time, take a number and wait but if they say more than 30 minutes go elsewhere.
en-unannotated-12831	Stopped in for dinner after touring the Guinness Storehouse.
en-unannotated-12832	A bit out of it but everything walkable.
en-unannotated-12833	There could be some small improvements made to the room, but it is clean and comfortable.
en-unannotated-12834	Mediocre TV and no attached sports bar or lounge, although one is within walking distance.
en-unannotated-12835	Come here but don't expect dry-aged.
en-unannotated-12836	So good, we had to come back here again two days later.
en-unannotated-12837	We went to dine at Ramon Freixa a nice evening in June.
en-unannotated-12838	Very good.
